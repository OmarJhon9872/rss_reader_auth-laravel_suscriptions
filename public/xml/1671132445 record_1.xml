      <title>Protein metalation in a nutshell</title>
      <dc:description>
Metalation of proteins is logical within defined intracellular metal availabilities. Mis‐metalation is avoided because weaker binding metals are more available than tighter binding ones.







Metalation, the acquisition of metals by proteins, must avoid mis‐metalation with tighter binding metals. This is illustrated by four selected proteins that require different metals: all show similar ranked orders of affinity for bioavailable metals, as described in a universal affinity series (the Irving–Williams series). Crucially, cellular protein metalation occurs in competition with other metal binding sites. The strength of this competition defines the intracellular availability of each metal: its magnitude has been estimated by calibrating a cells' set of DNA‐binding, metal‐sensing, transcriptional regulators. This has established that metal availabilities (as free energies for forming metal complexes) are maintained to the inverse of the universal series. The tightest binding metals are least available. With these availabilities, correct metalation is achieved.

      <title>Bioinorganic supramolecular coordination complexes and their biomedical applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanomedicine requires the development of versatile multifunctional materials with modular design. In this context, self‐assembled supramolecular coordination complexes show great potential for biomedical applications, including imaging, therapy, drug delivery and theranostics.







The field of Bioinorganic Supramolecular Chemistry is an emerging research area including metal‐based supramolecules resulting from coordination‐driven self‐assembly (CDSA), whereby metal ions and organic ligands can be easily linked by metal–ligand bonds via Lewis' acid/base interactions. The focus of this ‘In a Nutshell’ review will be on the family of supramolecular coordination complexes, discrete entities formed by CDSA, which have recently captured widespread attention as a new class of versatile multifunctional materials with broad biological applications including molecular recognition, biosensing, therapy, imaging and drug delivery. Herein, we provide a summary of the state‐of‐the‐art use of these systems in biomedicine, with some selected representative examples, as well as our visions of the challenges and possible directions in the field.

      <title>Search and learning for unsupervised text generation</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
With the advances of deep learning techniques, text generation is attracting increasing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, because of its wide applications and because it is an essential component of AI. Traditional text generation systems are trained in a supervised way, requiring massive labeled parallel corpora. In this paper, I will introduce our recent work on search and learning approaches to unsupervised text generation, where a heuristic objective function estimates the quality of a candidate sentence, and discrete search algorithms generate a sentence by maximizing the search objective. A machine learning model further learns from the search results to smooth out noise and improve efficiency. Our approach is important to the industry for building minimal viable products for a new task; it also has high social impacts for saving human annotation labor and for processing low‐resource languages.

Abstract
This article summarizes the New Faculty Highlights talk with the same title at AAAI 2021. Intelligent agents such as different types of robots will soon become an integral part of our daily lives. In real‐world multi‐agent systems, the most fundamental challenges are assigning tasks to multiple agents (task‐level coordination problems) and planning collision‐free paths for the agents to task locations (motion‐level coordination problems). This article surveys four directions of our research on using intelligent planning techniques for the above multi‐agent coordination problems.

      <title>Learning causality with graphs</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a rocketing growth of machine learning methods on graph data, especially those powered by effective neural networks. Despite their success in different real‐world scenarios, the majority of these methods on graphs only focus on predictive or descriptive tasks, but lack consideration of causality. Causal inference can reveal the causality inside data, promote human understanding of the learning process and model prediction, and serve as a significant component of artificial intelligence (AI). An important problem in causal inference is causal effect estimation, which aims to estimate the causal effects of a certain treatment (e.g., prescription of medicine) on an outcome (e.g., cure of disease) at an individual level (e.g., each patient) or a population level (e.g., a group of patients). In this paper, we introduce the background of causal effect estimation from observational data, envision the challenges of causal effect estimation with graphs, and then summarize representative approaches of causal effect estimation with graphs in recent years. Furthermore, we provide some insights for future research directions in related area. Link to video abstract: https://youtu.be/BpDPOOqw‐ns</dc:description>

      <title>Is AI at human parity yet? A case study on speech recognition</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Claims have been made that speech recognition has achieved human parity, yet this does not appear to be the case in the real‐world applications that rely on it, especially for non‐native speakers. This then begs the questions: What does it even mean for an AI system to reach human parity? How is progress towards that goal being measured? This article focuses on the current state of speech recognition and the recent developments in benchmarking and measuring performance of AI models built for speech processing. Through the shift away from single metric benchmarks and specialized models and towards evaluating collections of diverse challenging tasks and generalized models, the ultimate goal of true human parity in commercial speech processing applications is hopefully on the near horizon.

      <title>Semi‐supervised classification of fundus images combined with CNN and GCN</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes, which is a kind of fundus lesion with specific changes. Early diagnosis of DR can effectively reduce the visual damage caused by DR. Due to the variety and different morphology of DR lesions, automatic classification of fundus images in mass screening can greatly save clinicians' diagnosis time. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel framework—graph attentional convolutional neural network (GACNN).


Methods and Materials
The network consists of convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN). The global and spatial features of fundus images are extracted by using CNN and GCN, and attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the adaptability of GCN to topology map. We adopt semi‐supervised method for classification, which greatly improves the generalization ability of the network.


Results
In order to verify the effectiveness of the network, we conducted comparative experiments and ablation experiments. We use confusion matrix, precision, recall, kappa score, and accuracy as evaluation indexes. With the increase of the labeling rates, the classification accuracy is higher. Particularly, when the labeling rate is set to 100%, the classification accuracy of GACNN reaches 93.35%. Compared with DenseNet121, the accuracy rate is improved by 6.24%.


Conclusions
Semi‐supervised classification based on attention mechanism can effectively improve the classification performance of the model, and attain preferable results in classification indexes such as accuracy and recall. GACNN provides a feasible classification scheme for fundus images, which effectively reduces the screening human resources.

      <title>Evaluation of the clinical impact of the differences between planned and delivered dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy based on CT‐on‐rails IGRT and patient‐reported outcome scores</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
To estimate the clinical impact of differences between delivered and planned dose using dose metrics and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modeling.


Methods
Forty‐six consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2010 and 2015 treated with intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and who had undergone computed tomography on rails imaging were included. Delivered doses to bladder and rectum were estimated using a contour‐based deformable image registration method. The bladder and rectum NTCP were calculated using dose–response parameters applied to planned and delivered dose distributions. Seven urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms were prospectively collected using the validated prostate cancer symptom indices patient reported outcome (PRO) at pre‐treatment, weekly treatment, and post‐treatment follow‐up visits. Correlations between planned and delivered doses against PRO were evaluated in this study.


Results
Planned mean doses to bladder and rectum were 44.9 ± 13.6 Gy and 42.8 ± 7.3 Gy, while delivered doses were 46.1 ± 13.4 Gy and 41.3 ± 8.7 Gy, respectively. D10cc for rectum was 64.1 ± 7.6 Gy for planned and 60.1 ± 9.3 Gy for delivered doses. NTCP values of treatment plan were 22.3% ± 8.4% and 12.6% ± 5.9%, while those for delivered doses were 23.2% ± 8.4% and 9.9% ± 8.3% for bladder and rectum, respectively. Seven of 25 patients with follow‐up data showed urinary complications (28%) and three had rectal complications (12%). Correlations of NTCP values of planned and delivered doses with PRO follow‐up data were random for bladder and moderate for rectum (0.68 and 0.67, respectively).


Conclusion
Sensitivity of bladder to clinical variations of dose accumulation indicates that an automated solution based on a DIR that considers inter‐fractional organ deformation could recommend intervention. This is intended to achieve additional rectum sparing in cases that indicate higher than expected dose accumulation early during patient treatment in order to prevent acute severity of bowel symptoms.

      <title>Feasibility of radical cardiac‐sparing, treatment planning strategies for patients with locally advanced, non‐small cell lung cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
A set of treatment planning strategies were designed and retrospectively implemented for locally advanced, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in order to minimize cardiac dose without compromising target coverage goals.


Methods
Retrospective analysis was performed for 20 NSCLC patients prescribed to 60–66 Gy that received a mean heart dose (MHD) ≥10 Gy. Three planning approaches were designed and implemented. The first was a multi‐isocentric (MI) volume‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach (HEART_MI) with one isocenter located within the tumor and the second chosen up to 10 cm away longitudinally. The second was a noncoplanar (NCP) VMAT approach (HEART_NCP) utilizing up to three large couch angles and a standard arc at couch 0. The final planning strategy took a mixed approach (HEART_HYBRID) utilizing the HEART_NCP strategy for two thirds of the treatment combined with a plan utilizing a pair of opposite‐opposed gantry angles for the remaining treatments. Investigational plans were compared to original plans using dose–volume histogram metrics such as organ volume receiving greater than x Gy (Vx) or mean dose (Dmean).


Results
Although there was a small but statistically significant decrease in internal target volume coverage for HEART_MI plans and, conversely, a statistically significant increase for HEART_NCP plans, all generated plans met physician‐prescribed target constraints. For heart dose, there were statistically significant decreases in all heart metrics and particularly MHD for the HEART_MI (9.8 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001], respectively), HEART_NCP (9.2 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001]), respectively), and HEART_HYBRID (7.9 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001], respectively) strategies.


Conclusions
The strategy providing the best compromise between plan quality and cardiac dose reduction was HEART_NCP, which produced MHD reductions of 37.6% ± 12.9% (6.2 ± 3.4 Gy) relative to original plans. This strategy could potentially reduce adverse cardiac events, leading to improved quality of life for these patients.

Abstract
Positron emission tomography with x‐ray computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly being utilized for radiation treatment planning (RTP). Accurate delivery of RT therefore depends on quality PET/CT data. This study covers quality control (QC) procedures required for PET/CT for diagnostic imaging and incremental QC required for RTP. Based on a review of the literature, it compiles a list of recommended tests, performance frequencies, and tolerances, as well as references to documents detailing how to perform each test.

Abstract
This section focuses on the professional workforce comprised of the primary medical specialties that utilize ionizing radiation in their practices. Those discussed include the specialties of radiology and radiation oncology, as well as the subspecialties of radiology, namely diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology, nuclear radiology, and nuclear medicine. These professionals provide essential health care services, for example, the interpretation of imaging studies, the provision of interventional procedures, radionuclide therapeutic treatments, and radiation therapy. In addition, they may be called on to function as part of a radiologic emergency response team to care for potentially exposed persons following radiation events, for example, detonation of a nuclear weapon, nuclear power plant accidents, and transportation incidents. For these reasons, maintenance of an adequate workforce in each of these professions is essential to meeting the nation's future needs. Currently, there is a shortage for all physicians in the medical radiology workforce.

      <title>A component method to delineate surgical spine implants for proton Monte Carlo dose calculation</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
Metallic implants have been correlated to local control failure for spinal sarcoma and chordoma patients due to the uncertainty of implant delineation from computed tomography (CT). Such uncertainty can compromise the proton Monte Carlo dose calculation (MCDC) accuracy. A component method is proposed to determine the dimension and volume of the implants from CT images.


Methods
The proposed component method leverages the knowledge of surgical implants from medical supply vendors to predefine accurate contours for each implant component, including tulips, screw bodies, lockers, and rods. A retrospective patient study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The reference implant materials and samples were collected from patient medical records and vendors, Medtronic and NuVasive. Additional CT images with extensive features, such as extended Hounsfield units and various reconstruction diameters, were used to quantify the uncertainty of implant contours.


Results
For in vivo patient implant estimation, the reference and the component method differences were 0.35, 0.17, and 0.04 cm3 for tulips, screw bodies, and rods, respectively. The discrepancies by a conventional threshold method were 5.46, 0.76, and 0.05 cm3, respectively. The mischaracterization of implant materials and dimensions can underdose the clinical target volume coverage by 20 cm3 for a patient with eight lumbar implants. The tulip dominates the dosimetry uncertainty as it can be made from titanium or cobalt–chromium alloys by different vendors.


Conclusions
A component method was developed and demonstrated using phantom and patient studies with implants. The proposed method provides more accurate implant characterization for proton MCDC and can potentially enhance the treatment quality for proton therapy. The current proof‐of‐concept study is limited to the implant characterization for lumbar spine. Future investigations could be extended to cervical spine and dental implants for head‐and‐neck patients where tight margins are required to spare organs at risk.

      <title>Automated field‐in‐field whole brain radiotherapy planning</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
We developed and tested an automatic field‐in‐field (FIF) solution for whole‐brain radiotherapy (WBRT) planning that creates a homogeneous dose distribution by minimizing hotspots, resulting in clinically acceptable plans.


Methods
A configurable auto‐planning algorithm was developed to automatically generate FIF WBRT plans independent of the treatment planning system. Configurable parameters include the definition of hotspots, target volume, maximum number of subfields, and minimum number of monitor units per field. This algorithm iteratively identifies a hotspot, creates two opposing subfields, calculates the dose, and optimizes the beam weight based on user‐configured constraints of dose‐volume histogram coverage and least‐squared cost functions. The algorithm was retrospectively tested on 17 whole‐brain patients. First, an in‐house landmark‐based automated beam aperture technique was used to generate the treatment fields and initial plans. Second, the FIF algorithm was employed to optimize the plans using physician‐defined goals of 99.9% of the brain volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and a target hotspot definition of 107% of the prescription dose. The final auto‐optimized plans were assessed for clinical acceptability by an experienced radiation oncologist using a five‐point scale.


Results
The FIF algorithm reduced the mean (± SD) plan hotspot percentage dose from 35.0 Gy (116.6%) ± 0.6 Gy (2.0%) to 32.6 Gy (108.8%) ± 0.4 Gy (1.2%). Also, it decreased the mean (± SD) hotspot V107% [cm3] from 959 ± 498 cm3 to 145 ± 224 cm3. On average, plans were produced in 16 min without any user intervention. Furthermore, 76.5% of the auto‐plans were clinically acceptable (needing no or minor stylistic edits), and all of them were clinically acceptable after minor clinically necessary edits.


Conclusions
This algorithm successfully produced high‐quality WBRT plans and can improve treatment planning efficiency when incorporated into an automatic planning workflow.

      <title>Customizable landmark‐based field aperture design for automated whole‐brain radiotherapy treatment planning</title>
      <dc:description>

Purpose
To develop and evaluate an automated whole‐brain radiotherapy (WBRT) treatment planning pipeline with a deep learning–based auto‐contouring and customizable landmark‐based field aperture design.


Methods
The pipeline consisted of the following steps: (1) Auto‐contour normal structures on computed tomography scans and digitally reconstructed radiographs using deep learning techniques, (2) locate the landmark structures using the beam's‐eye‐view, (3) generate field apertures based on eight different landmark rules addressing different clinical purposes and physician preferences. Two parallel approaches for generating field apertures were developed for quality control. The performance of the generated field shapes and dose distributions were compared with the original clinical plans. The clinical acceptability of the plans was assessed by five radiation oncologists from four hospitals.


Results
The performance of the generated field apertures was evaluated by the Hausdorff distance (HD) and mean surface distance (MSD) from 182 patients’ field apertures used in the clinic. The average HD and MSD for the generated field apertures were 16 ± 7 and 7 ± 3 mm for the first approach, respectively, and 17 ± 7 and 7 ± 3 mm, respectively, for the second approach. The differences regarding HD and MSD between the first and the second approaches were 1 ± 2 and 1 ± 3 mm, respectively. A clinical review of the field aperture design, conducted using 30 patients, achieved a 100% acceptance rate for both the first and second approaches, and the plan review achieved a 100% acceptance rate for the first approach and a 93% acceptance rate for the second approach. The average acceptance rate for meeting lens dosimetric recommendations was 80% (left lens) and 77% (right lens) for the first approach, and 70% (both left and right lenses) for the second approach, compared with 50% (left lens) and 53% (right lens) for the clinical plans.


Conclusion
This study provided an automated pipeline with two field aperture generation approaches to automatically generate WBRT treatment plans. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated that our novel pipeline was comparable with the original clinical plans.

      <title>Fully automatic tumor segmentation of breast ultrasound images with deep learning</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Background
Breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is one of the most prevalent approaches for the detection of breast cancers. Tumor segmentation of BUS images can facilitate doctors in localizing tumors and is a necessary step for computer‐aided diagnosis systems. While the majority of clinical BUS scans are normal ones without tumors, segmentation approaches such as U‐Net often predict mass regions for these images. Such false‐positive problem becomes serious if a fully automatic artificial intelligence system is used for routine screening.


Methods
In this study, we proposed a novel model which is more suitable for routine BUS screening. The model contains a classification branch that determines whether the image is normal or with tumors, and a segmentation branch that outlines tumors. Two branches share the same encoder network. We also built a new dataset that contains 1600 BUS images from 625 patients for training and a testing dataset with 130 images from 120 patients for testing. The dataset is the largest one with pixel‐wise masks manually segmented by experienced radiologists. Our code is available at https://github.com/szhangNJU/BUS_segmentation.


Results
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for classifying images into normal/abnormal categories was 0.991. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for segmentation of mass regions was 0.898, better than the state‐of‐the‐art models. Testing on an external dataset gave a similar performance, demonstrating a good transferability of our model. Moreover, we simulated the use of the model in actual clinic practice by processing videos recorded during BUS scans; the model gave very low false‐positive predictions on normal images without sacrificing sensitivities for images with tumors.


Conclusions
Our model achieved better segmentation performance than the state‐of‐the‐art models and showed a good transferability on an external test set. The proposed deep learning architecture holds potential for use in fully automatic BUS health screening.

      <title>The effect of microlevel and macrolevel signaling on learning with 360° videos</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of 360° videos raised the attention of educators and researchers, as it appears to be an approachable option to mediate complete environments in educational settings. However, challenges emerge from the perspective of educational psychology. Learning irrelevant cognitive strains might be imposed because it is necessary to navigate through spherical material. However, these potential downsides could be compensated for using signaling techniques. In a two (macrolevel vs. no macrolevel signaling) × two (microlevel vs. no microlevel signaling) factorial between‐subjects design plus control group, 215 fifth‐and sixth‐grade students will watch a 360° video about visual and behavioral characteristics of animals. Learning outcomes, cognitive load, disorientation, and presence will be investigated. It is expected that macrolevel signaling will enhance learning and presence and reduce cognitive load and disorientation. Microlevel signaling will have comparable advantages, but these effects will be more pronounced when macrolevel signaling is implemented.

      <title>Predicting chronic opioid use among patients with osteoarthritis using electronic health record data</title>
      <dc:description>

Objective
To estimate the risk, using electronic health record (EHR) data and predictive models, of a patient with osteoarthritis (OA) developing chronic opioid use (COU) within 1 year of a new opioid prescription.


Methods
We used EHR data from 13 healthcare organizations to identify OA patients with an opioid prescription between 03/01/2017 and 02/28/2019 and no record of opioid use in the prior 6 months. We evaluated 4 machine learning models to estimate patients’ risk of COU (≥3 prescriptions over ≥84 days, maximum gap ≤60 days). We also estimated the transportability of models to organizations outside the training set.


Results
The cohort consisted of 33,894 patients with OA, of whom 2,925 (8.6%) developed COU within 1 year. All models demonstrated good discrimination, with the best‐performing model (random forest) achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.728 (95% CI, 0.711–0.745), but the simplest regression model performed nearly as well (AUC of 0.717; 95% CI, 0.699–0.734). Predicted risk deciles spanned a range of 2% risk for the 10th percentile to 18% risk for the 90th percentile for well‐calibrated models. Models showed highly variable discrimination across organizations (AUC 0.571–0.842).


Conclusions
We found that EHR‐based predictive models could estimate the risk of future COU among OA patients to help inform care decisions. Black‐box methods did not have significant advantages over more interpretable models. Care should be taken when extending all models into organizations not included in model training due to high variability in performance across held‐out organizations.

      <title>Prediction Models to Estimate The Future Risk of Osteoarthritis in the General Population: A Systematic Review</title>
      <dc:description>

Objective
To evaluate the performance and applicability of multivariable prediction models for osteoarthritis (OA).


Methods
Systematic review and narrative synthesis using three databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science; inception to December 2021). We included general population longitudinal studies reporting derivation, comparison, or validation of multivariable models to predict individual risk of OA incidence, defined by recognised clinical or imaging criteria. We excluded studies reporting prevalent OA and joint arthroplasty outcome. Paired reviewers independently performed article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Model performance, calibration and retained predictors were summarised.


Results
26 studies were included reporting 31 final multivariable prediction models for incident knee (23), hip (4), hand (3) and any‐site OA (1), with a median of outcome events of 121.5 (range: 27‐12,803), median prediction horizon of 8 years (2‐41), and a median of 6 predictors (3‐24). Age, body mass index, previous injury, and occupational exposures were among the most commonly included predictors. Model discrimination after validation was generally acceptable to excellent (Area Under the Curve = 0.70 to 0.85). Either internal or external validation processes were used in most models although risk of bias was often judged to be high with limited applicability to mass application in diverse populations.


Conclusion
Despite growing interest in multivariable prediction models for incident OA, there remains a predominant focus on the knee, reliance on data from a small pool of appropriate cohort datasets, and concerns over general population applicability.

      <title>Female Sex, Age, and Unfavorable Response to Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors in Patients With Axial Spondyloarthritis: Results of Statistical and Artificial Intelligence–Based Data Analyses of a National Multicenter Prospective Registry</title>
      <dc:description>

Objective
Real‐world studies are needed to identify factors associated with response to biologic therapies in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). The objective was to assess sex differences in response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and to explore possible risk factors associated with TNFi efficacy.


Methods
A total of 969 patients with axial SpA (315 females, 654 males) enrolled in the BIOBADASER registry (2000–2019) who initiated a TNFi (first, second, or further lines) were studied. Statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)–based data analyses were used to explore the association of sex differences and other factors to TNFi response, using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), to calculate the BASDAI50, with an improvement of at least 50% of the BASDAI score, and using the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score, calculated using the C‐reactive protein level (ASDAS‐CRP).


Results
Females had a lower probability of reaching a BASDAI50 response with a first line TNFi treatment at the second year of follow‐up (P = 0.018) and a lesser reduction of the ASDAS‐CRP at this time point. The logistic regression model showed lower BASDAI50 responses to TNFi in females (P = 0.05). Other factors, such as older age (P = 0.004), were associated with unfavorable responses. The AI data analyses reinforced the idea that age at the beginning of the treatment was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response. The combination of age with other clinical characteristics (female sex or cardiovascular risk factors and events) potentially contributed to an unfavorable response to TNFi.


Conclusion
In this national multicenter registry, female sex was associated with less response to a first‐line TNFi by the second year of follow‐up. A higher age at the start of the TNFi was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response to TNFi.

The logistic regression model showed lower BASDAI50 responses to TNFi in females (P = 0.05). Other factors, such as older age (P = 0.004), were associated with unfavorable responses. The AI data analyses reinforced the idea that age at the beginning of the treatment was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response. The combination of age with other clinical characteristics (female sex or cardiovascular risk factors and events) potentially contributed to an unfavorable response to TNFi.


Conclusion
In this national multicenter registry, female sex was associated with less response to a first‐line TNFi by the second year of follow‐up. A higher age at the start of the TNFi was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response to TNFi.

      <title>IoT enabled lung cancer detection and routing algorithm using CBSOA‐based ShCNN</title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously spread worldwide, and it influenced the world through easy connectivity, interoperability, and interconnectivity using IoT devices. Numerous techniques have been developed using IoT‐enabled health care systems for cancer detection, but some limitations exist in transmitting the health data to the cloud. The limitations can be accomplished using the proposed chronological‐based social optimization algorithm (CBSOA) that effectively transmits the patient's health data using IoT network, thereby detecting lung cancer in an effective way. Initially, nodes in the IoT network are simulated such that patient's health data are collected, and for transmission of such data, routing is performed in order to transmit the health data from source to destination through a gateway based on cloud service using CBSOA. The fitness is newly modeled by assuming the factors like energy, distance, trust, delay, and link quality. Finally, lung cancer detection is carried out at the destination point. At the destination point, the acquired input data is fed to preprocessing phase to make the data acceptable for further mechanism using data normalization. Once the feature selection is done using Canberra distance, then the lung cancer detection is performed using shepard convolutional neural network (ShCNN). The process of routing as well as training of ShCNN is performed using the CBSOA algorithm, which is devised by the inclusion of the chronological concept into the social optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.940, maximum sensitivity of 0.941, maximum specificity of 0.928, and minimum energy of 0.452.

      <dc:description>
With an increasing interest in artificial‐cell studies, DNA droplets, a phase‐separated coacervate of DNA, have emerged as a powerful platform for creating intelligent cell‐like systems. DNA sequence recognition capability shapes the distinctive programmability of their structures, functions, and behaviors. This review showcases the latest progress, and discusses the perspectives and challenges of DNA droplets as intelligent and dynamic fluidic systems.








Abstract
Breathtaking advances in DNA nanotechnology have established DNA as a promising biomaterial for the fabrication of programmable higher‐order nano/microstructures. In the context of developing artificial cells and tissues, DNA droplets have emerged as a powerful platform for creating intelligent, dynamic cell‐like machinery. DNA droplets are a microscale membrane‐free coacervate of DNA formed through phase separation. This new type of DNA system couples dynamic fluid‐like property with long‐established DNA programmability. This hybrid nature offers an advantageous route to facile and robust control over the structures, functions, and behaviors of DNA droplets. This review begins by describing programmable DNA condensation, commenting on the physical properties and fabrication strategies of DNA hydrogels and droplets. By presenting an overview of the development pathways leading to DNA droplets, it is shown that DNA technology has evolved from static, rigid systems to soft, dynamic systems. Next, the basic characteristics of DNA droplets are described as intelligent, dynamic fluid by showcasing the latest examples highlighting their distinctive features related to sequence‐specific interactions and programmable mechanical properties. Finally, this review discusses the potential and challenges of numerical modeling able to connect a robust link between individual sequences and macroscopic mechanical properties of DNA droplets.

      <title>Multiscale Biofabrication: Integrating Additive Manufacturing with DNA‐Programmable Self‐Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of additive manufacturing techniques with bottom‐up self‐assembly allows the fabrication of macroscopic synthetic biological objects with a structure defined at the sub‐micrometer level. This review gives an overview of advances in this direction, with a particular focus on the use of DNA self‐assembly and self‐organization in this context.








Abstract
Structure and hierarchical organization are crucial elements of biological systems and are likely required when engineering synthetic biomaterials with life‐like behavior. In this context, additive manufacturing techniques like bioprinting have become increasingly popular. However, 3D bioprinting, as well as other additive manufacturing techniques, show limited resolution, making it difficult to yield structures on the sub‐cellular level. To be able to form macroscopic synthetic biological objects with structuring on this level, manufacturing techniques have to be used in conjunction with biomolecular nanotechnology. Here, a short overview of both topics and a survey of recent advances to combine additive manufacturing with microfabrication techniques and bottom‐up self‐assembly involving DNA, are given.

      <title>Research on automatic control algorithms for the motion of redundant robotic arms of industrial robots</title>
      <dc:description>Aiming at the motion control of redundant manipulator of industrial robot, a multi‐objective control algorithm based onimproved generalized weighted least square method is proposed. The experimental results show that the error of the proposed algorithm is significantly less than that of the traditional control algorithm.

Abstract
The development of intelligent technology has led to the more frequent use of robots in industrial production, but the control problems in the redundant robotic arms of industrial robots have hindered their normal development. Therefore, in the study, in order to achieve automatic control of the redundant robotic arm of industrial robots, a multi‐objective redundant robotic arm automatic control algorithm based on improved generalized weighted least squares and multi‐objective feedback teaching and learning optimization algorithm is proposed. In the results, it is shown that the multi‐objective optimization algorithm is effective for the control of the redundant robotic arm, and from the rectification results it is shown that the speed and position errors are only manifested at 0.005 s after time and there is no difference between its speed and position values. The above results show that for the automatic control of redundant robotic arms of industrial robots, the use of multi‐objective optimization control is effective and can provide theoretical support for industrial production and industrial development, thus promoting the development of China's market economy.

      <title>4D Printing of Shape Memory Polymers, Blends, and Composites and Their Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Literature Review</title>
      <dc:description>
This article reports on the progress of the 4D printing of shape memory polymers and composite materials. The mechanisms by which parts change shape when subjected to an external stimulus and properties are investigated. Furthermore, innovative applications of 4D printing in different fields are presented.


4D printing is defined as the additive manufacturing process of smart (stimuli‐responsive) materials. Shape memory materials are sensitive to specific stimuli such as heat, electricity, magnetic fields, etc., which can change their form or properties. This characteristic gives the material a dynamic behavior over time (the fourth dimension). The application of the 4D printing technique is currently being explored in various fields, including soft robotics, electrical devices, deployable structures, medical implants, and medicine delivery systems. This article first examines the fundamentals of 3D printing techniques, their advantages, and limitations. Then, the shape memory materials are categorized and reviewed according to their type (shape memory polymers, shape memory composites, polymer blends, etc.) and stimulus responsiveness. Finally, different properties of shape memory materials like shape memory effect, thermomechanical properties, and their compatibility with different types of additive manufacturing processes are discussed.

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of High‐Entropy CrMoNbTaVW Thin Films Using High‐Throughput Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, a time‐efficient investigation of complex‐concentration CrMoNbTaVW alloys is presented. High‐throughput synthesis and automated characterization and analysis techniques provide a large dataset that can be used to create data libraries for complex material systems.


High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) or complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) offer a huge research area for new material compositions and potential applications. Since the combination of several elements sometimes leads to unexpected and unpredictable material properties. In addition to the element combinations, the optimization of the element proportions in CCAs and HEAs is also a decisive factor in tailoring desired material properties. However, it is almost impossible to achieve the composition and characterization of CCAs and HEAs with a sufficient number of compositions by conventional experiments. Therefore, an optimized high‐throughput magnetron sputtering synthesis to fabricate a new HEA gradient layer of six elements is presented. With this approach, the compositional space of the HEA system CrMoNbTaVW can be studied in different subsections to determine the influence of the individual elements and their combinations on the structure, morphology, and physical properties (hardness and resistivity). It is found that the Cr‐, Ta‐, and W‐rich phases, which have a grain size of 10–11 nm, exhibit the hardest mechanical properties, whereas V‐, Ta‐, and Cr‐rich compounds exhibit the highest electrical resistivity. The combination of high‐throughput synthesis, automated analysis tools, and automated data interpretation enables rapid and time‐efficient characterization of the novel CrMoNbTaVW gradient film.

      <title>A Perspective on Methods to Computationally Design the Morphology of Aerogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, the author aims at elucidating the diverse methodologies and modeling approaches applied to design or construct the open‐porous morphology of aerogels. Insights into the pros and cons of these techniques and an outlook toward improving or extending these models and the application of machine learning approaches are provided.


Reconstructing aerogel morphology presents significant challenges, in particular, if 3D visualizations of their mesoporous network are desired. Available microscopic and tomographic tools find it difficult to probe into all types of aerogels for the purposes of reconstructing their 3D nanoporous morphology. This is where computational approaches have shown promising efforts. Herein, diverse models that can be applied to describing different aerogels are explored. To begin with, cluster–cluster aggregation models are examined for simulating the sol–gel process and the resulting morphologies in fractal aerogels, e.g., silica‐based. Gaussian random field models and polymerization‐induced phase separation models are explored for modeling organic non‐fractal aerogels, e.g., resorcinol‐formaldehyde (RF) ones. This is followed by Langevin‐dynamics‐based discrete element models that are explored for simulating gelation in fibrillar aerogels, e.g., those from biopolymer sources. Lastly, modified Voronoi approaches are investigated for describing the 3D fibrillar morphology, also of fibrillar aerogels, like those from biopolymers. A perspective is presented highlighting the strengths as well as shortcomings in each of the model approaches. Possibilities to either extend available approaches or explore new ones are briefly discussed at every interval.

Herein, the author aims at elucidating the diverse methodologies and modeling approaches applied to design or construct the open‐porous morphology of aerogels. Insights into the pros and cons of these techniques and an outlook toward improving or extending these models and the application of machine learning approaches are provided.


Reconstructing aerogel morphology presents significant challenges, in particular, if 3D visualizations of their mesoporous network are desired. Available microscopic and tomographic tools find it difficult to probe into all types of aerogels for the purposes of reconstructing their 3D nanoporous morphology. This is where computational approaches have shown promising efforts. Herein, diverse models that can be applied to describing different aerogels are explored. To begin with, cluster–cluster aggregation models are examined for simulating the sol–gel process and the resulting morphologies in fractal aerogels, e.g., silica‐based. Gaussian random field models and polymerization‐induced phase separation models are explored for modeling organic non‐fractal aerogels, e.g., resorcinol‐formaldehyde (RF) ones. This is followed by Langevin‐dynamics‐based discrete element models that are explored for simulating gelation in fibrillar aerogels, e.g., those from biopolymer sources. Lastly, modified Voronoi approaches are investigated for describing the 3D fibrillar morphology, also of fibrillar aerogels, like those from biopolymers. A perspective is presented highlighting the strengths as well as shortcomings in each of the model approaches. Possibilities to either extend available approaches or explore new ones are briefly discussed at every interval.

      <title>Adhesive Hybrid Interpenetrating Network Hydrogel‐Based Detector to Monitor Solar Radiation Dose Required for Plant Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on an excellent photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) in combination with low weight, a hybrid interpenetration polymer network hydrogel on polypropylene fabrics is designed into a solar radiation detector, which can be easily adhered onto plant leaves and monitor the solar radiation dose required for the growth of a plant like Epipremnum aureum by checking the discoloration under sunshine.


An adhesive and visualized hydrogel‐based detector is designed to monitor the solar radiation dose required for plant growth by the discoloration of methylene blue (MB) under sunshine. The detector is based on hybrid hydrogels prepared from photoinitiated polymerization. The combination of polypropylene (PP) fabrics acting as a substrate and the photoinitiated polymerization on the graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) surface enables a smaller thickness and a more homogenous distribution of the g‐C3N4 nanosheets. Thus, the hybrid interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel on the PP fabrics with a thickness of 1.5 mm presents an improved photodegradation capability. In addition, better mechanical properties and lower weight of the hydrogel‐based detector are achieved by the presence of the PP fabrics. In combination with the stickiness from a polyurethane resin acting as glue, the obtained detector can be easily pasted on the leaf of a plant as demonstrated for the example of Epipremnum aureum. The radiation dose exposed to the leaves can be accurately traced from the change in color of the detector to ensure a sufficient radiation for plant growth and avoid possible burn to the leaves under sunshine.

      <title>Electroactive Bistable Actuators with Tunable Snap‐through Performances and Adjustable Mechanical Bending Modes for Ultrafast Bioinspired Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Shape‐memory alloy (SMA) actuators typically exhibit limited response speed owing to the long duration required for the alloy to cool down and return to its natural shape and compliance after electrically‐thermal actuation. This paper proposes a generic design principle for harnessing the mechanical instability of the bistable mechanism to improve the response properties and output force of SMA actuators. The SMA actuator presented herein is constructed by combining spring‐based bistable linkages and SMA springs as a “skeletal spine” and “skeletal muscles,” respectively. Most existing SMA actuators are designed as inherently and unimodally stable, whereas the working performance of our design suggests that it rapidly stores and releases energy within tens of milliseconds by regulating the bistable mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a highly dynamic SMA actuator that can generate a force of ∽3.4 N, bend through 60o in 0.05 s, and achieve periodic deformation under the alternating actuation of two SMA springs. Furthermore, two representative demonstrations of dynamic impact excitation and jumping are verified. Owing to these properties, the actuator can pave a new path toward constructing next‐generation, high‐performance smart actuators with multiple scales and functionalities. It can be applied to next‐generation high‐performance robotic or actuation systems with multifunctional characteristics.

      <title>X‐ray Tomography and Tomoscopy on Metals: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
X‐ray tomography is a versatile tool in materials research and engineering since it allows for a non‐destructive and three‐dimensional mapping of the constituents of a heterogeneous material as long as they differ in their interactions with X‐rays. Recent developments of the technique have brought down the time needed for the acquisition of a single tomogram by many orders of magnitude compared to what was needed 25 years ago. Nowadays, up to 1000 full tomograms can be recorded in a second, which enables real‐time studies of changes in samples caused by reactions or by applied processing operations. The term tomoscopy has been coined for such sequences of 3D images. We review the application of X‐ray tomography and tomoscopy on metals and describe each step required and the associated challenges. A selection of representative investigations is presented with a focus on time‐resolved phenomena in metals and alloys ranging from mechanical deformation, solidification to metals processing processes such as welding and additive manufacturing. Finally likely future developments are discussed.

      <title>Volatile 2D Ruddlesden‐Popper Perovskite: A Gift for α‐Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
2D perovskites in situ generated from a series of bulky primary alkylammoniums are found to be volatile and are used to prepare phase‐ and compositionally‐pure α‐formamidinium lead triiodide solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells with increasingly pure composition of α‐formamidinium lead triiodide (α‐FAPbI3) perovskite are utilized to set more and more record‐breaking efficiencies. However, pure α‐FAPbI3 perovskite is unstable and difficult to prepare. Here, a series of bulky alkylammoniums known as the spacer cations (RP cations) of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (2D perovskites) are used to prepare α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films. The deprotonation process of RP cations during annealing removes the in situ generated 2D perovskites from the film, which determines the phase and compositional purity, crystallinity, and stability of α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films and depends on the design of RP cations. Only a small number of residual RP cations (0.3–2.3%) are found anchoring at grain boundaries. As a result, α‐FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared from RP cations, especially 2‐thiophenemethylammonium, show higher efficiency and stability than control devices prepared from the most commonly used methylammonium. It is believed that in situ generated 2D perovskites are ideal additives for α‐FAPbI3 perovskite, because a large addition (20%) of 2D perovskites ensures the preparation of high‐quality phase‐pure α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films, while a small number of residual RP cations anchored at grain boundaries guarantee the performance and stability of α‐FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells.

      <title>Immunocyte‐Derived Nanodrugs for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the advancements of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs, including membrane‐coated nanoparticles, exosomes or extracellular vesicles, functional protein‐incorporated nanoparticles, and exosome mimetics, is presented, with an emphasis on their preparation, structure, properties, and latest applications in cancer therapy. The current limitations and future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of the biomimetic nanotechnology regarding the use of certain components (such as cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, proteins, etc.) derived from different cells to fabricate nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer treatment. These biomimetic NPs usually inherit certain abilities from their parental cells, such as long blood circulation, capacity to escape from mononuclear phagocytic system, active tumor‐targeting, and controlled drug release. Immunocytes play vital roles in different tumor progression stages, and can quickly and accurately react to tumor progression via specific targeting and immune surveillance. Therefore, increasing studies focus on constructing biomimetic NPs with components isolated from immunocytes. This review introduces four main types of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs—membrane‐coated NPs, exosomes or extracellular vesicles, functional protein‐incorporated NPs, and exosome mimetics—and summarizes the recent advances of these nanodrugs for cancer therapy. Some current challenges and future research directions of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs are also proposed. It is hoped that this review may help researchers in the related field to design new immunocyte‐derived nanomedicines and promote their preclinical and clinical applications in the near future.

      <title>Wood Robot with Magnetic Anisotropy for Programmable Locomotion</title>
      <dc:description>
A magnetic wood robot is fabricated by the delignification and NdFeB impregnation, which can achieve fast and programmable locomotion including spatial flipping, bypass obstacles, climb up and down under the driven by a rotating magnetic field.








Abstract
The development of environmentally‐friendly stimuli‐responsive materials is vital to green electronics, sensors, and biomedicine. However, fast responsiveness and precise locomotion control of biomass materials have not been accomplished. Herein, a magnetically responsive wood is reported that can achieve programmable locomotion in the rotating magnetic field. The magnetized wood is fabricated by removing lignin from the cell walls, which produces a porous microstructure, enabling facile and stable combination between NdFeB and wood. With the directional arrangement of magnetic moments after magnetization, the magnetized wood with obviously positive and negative magnetic poles is magnetic stability, and can complete various movements including spatial flipping, bypass obstacles, climb up, and down under the driven by magnetic torques. Meanwhile, the magnetized wood is lightweight (0.26 g cm−3), showing a fast walking speed of up to 11.3 mm s−1 under magnetic actuation (10 mT and 0.6 Hz), which is greater than those of petroleum‐based polymeric materials. Benefitting from the unique porous structure, the magnetized wood can be used as the drug‐carrier to deliver and release nano‐cargoes effectively. This approach expands the range of stimuli‐responsive materials beyond hydrogel, elastomers, and synthetic polymer, inspiring the creation of next‐generation intelligent robots based on biocompatible and sustainable biomass materials.

      <title>Subaqueous Bioprinting: A Novel Strategy for Fetal Membrane Repair with 7‐Axis Robot‐Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
      <dc:description>
The 7‐axis bioprinting robot combined with an ultrafast photo‐responsive hydrogel enables minimally invasive subaqueous in vivo bioprinting and construction of specifically designed hydrogel patch to seal premature rupture of membranes (PROM), providing a novel strategy for the treatment of PROM and other diseases involving tissue injury in clinical settings.








Abstract
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM), defined as breakage of the amniotic sac prior to delivery, complicates 2–4% of pregnancies, leads to one‐third of preterm births, and increases the risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity in survivors. In situ bioprinting enables the fabrication of 3D structures directly for tissue repair or reconstruction in living animals, but is challenging to perform in the subaqueous narrow space where fetal membranes are located. This study reports a novel strategy consisting of an ultrafast photoresponsive hydrogel (1.5 s) and a 7‐axis bioprinting robot to perform subaqueous in situ bioprinting in a minimally invasive approach. Specially, a hydrogel patch with designed gel rivets is printed subaqueously for the therapeutic needs of PROM, and the patch displays robust tissue adhesion, favorable biocompatibility, mechanical properties resembling native tissues, and an appropriate sealing timescale to prolong pregnancy. Experiments performed in an in vitro uterus model and a mid‐gestational rabbit model show a favorable sealing effect for PROM, which validates the potential of this subaqueous bioprinting approach for application. This study not only expands upon in situ bioprinting techniques, but also provides valuable insights for the treatment of PROM and other diseases involving tissue injury in clinical settings.

      <title>Understanding the Solution‐State Doping of Donor–Acceptor Polymers Through Tailored Side Chain Engineering for Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
The aggregation effects of donor–acceptor polymers on the molecular doping behavior are demonstrated by side chain engineering and comparison of doping methods for thermoelectric (TE) applications. According to aggregation behavior, Lewis complexes and doping compete, highly aggregated polymers restrict Lewis complex formation and facilitate doping, leading to high TE power factors of up to 23.7 µW m−1 K−2.








Abstract
Among the molecular doping methods widely utilized to control charge carriers in organic thermoelectric (TE) devices, solution mixing is attractive for the preparation of uniform and thick TE films to obtain high output powers. However, the effects of doping behavior in solution‐state polymers on their film properties are still not well understood, particularly for donor–acceptor (D‐A) polymers, key materials for high‐performance (opto)electronic devices. Here, by preparing three D‐A polymers with engineered side chains, the aggregation effects of D‐A polymers on the doping behavior in the solution and film states are demonstrated. In a less aggregated polymer, mixing the solution with a p‐dopant leads to the Lewis complex formation, which reduces doping efficiency and power factor. However, solution mixing of aggregated polymers induces the formation of ion pairs with the dopant, resulting in power factors that are two orders of magnitude higher at 23.7 µW m−1 K−2. Doping in the film state where aggregation is induced facilitates ion‐pair formation, resulting in smaller deviation in TE properties (power factors = 9.0–16.4 µW m−1 K−2) despite differences in their ordering structures. These results provide an in‐depth understanding of efficient solution‐state doping of D‐A polymers for TEs.

      <title>Electrospun Nanofiber‐Based Synaptic Transistor with Tunable Plasticity for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrospun ZnO nanofiber‐based transistor with tunable plasticity is fabricated by changing the technological parameters and the underlying mechanism of influence of carrier concentration and mobility on the device is revealed. Ultralow energy consumption and handwritten recognition application with high accuracy are realized in the perovskite‐doped devices to lay the foundation for next‐generation neuromorphic networks.








Abstract
Biological synapses are the operational connection of the neurons for signal transmission in neuromorphic networks and hardware implementation combined with electrospun 1D nanofibers have realized its functionality for complicated computing tasks in basic three‐terminal field‐effect transistors with gate‐controlled channel conductance. However, it still lacks the fundamental understanding that how the technological parameters influence the signal intensity of the information processing in the neural systems for the nanofiber‐based synaptic transistors. Here, by tuning the electrospinning parameters and introducing the channel surface doping, an electrospun ZnO nanofiber‐based transistor with tunable plasticity is presented to emulate the changing synaptic functions. The underlying mechanism of influence of carrier concentration and mobility on the device's electrical and synaptic performance is revealed as well. Short‐term plasticity behaviors including paired‐pulse facilitation, spike duration‐dependent plasticity, and dynamic filtering are tuned in this fiber‐based device. Furthermore, Perovskite‐doped devices with ultralow energy consumption down to ≈0.2554 fJ and their handwritten recognition application show the great potential of synaptic transistors based on a 1D nanostructure active layer for building next‐generation neuromorphic networks.

      <title>Multi‐Control of Ion Transport in a Field‐Effect Iontronic Device based on Sandwich‐Structured Nanochannels</title>
      <dc:description>
A field‐effect iontronic device based on ionomer/anodic aluminum oxide/conducting polymer sandwich‐structured nanochannel is constructed to realize the multi‐control of ion transport behaviors including ion conductance, ion current rectification (ICR magnitude, and ICR direction by modulating the surface charge, wettability, and morphology of the nanochannel. The tunable surface charge of electroactive conducting polymer and complex three‐segment structure contribute to the multi‐control of nanofluidic behaviors.








Abstract
Biomimetic smart nanochannels can regulate ion transport behavior responsive to the external stimuli, having huge potential in nanofluidic devices, sensors and energy conversion. Field‐effect nanofluidic diodes or transistors based on electric‐responsive nanochannels are emerging owing to their advantages such as non‐invasiveness, in situ, real time, and high efficiency. However, simultaneously realizing the voltage‐control of the ion conductance and ion current rectification (ICR) properties is still a big challenge. Here, a field‐effect iontronic device is developed based on ionomer/anodic aluminum oxide/conducting polymer sandwich‐structured nanochannel to realize the multi‐control of ion transport behaviors including ion conductance, ICR magnitude, and ICR direction by modulating the surface charge, wettability, and morphology of the nanochannel. The electroactive conducting polymer carries tunable surface charges responsive to the electric stimuli, leading to the regulation of ICR values. The complex three‐segment structures lead to the reverse of ICR direction by reconfiguring the charge distribution along with the whole channel. The switching wettability between hydrophilic and hydrophobic results in the regulation of ion conductance. Furthermore, the field‐effect iontronic device functions in a wide salinity range especially in hypersaline environment, due to the salinity‐adaptive properties of the membrane. A new route is provided for designing more functional field‐effect nanofluidic devices.

Developing efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical to the commercial viability of electrochemical clean energy technologies. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs), with the merits of abundant reserves, unique structure, tunable composition, and high electronic conductivity, are recognized as attractive HER catalytic materials. Nevertheless, the HER electrocatalytic activity of TMPs is still limited by various thorough issues and inherent performance bottlenecks. In this review, these issues are carefully sorted, and the corresponding reasonable explanations and solutions are elucidated on the basis of the HER catalytic activity origins of TMPs. Subsequently, highly targeted multiscale strategies to improve the HER performance of TMPs are comprehensively presented. Additionally, critical scientific issues for constructing high‐efficiency TMP‐based electrocatalysts are proposed. Finally, the HER reaction process, catalytic mechanism research, TMP‐based catalyst construction, and their application expansion are mentioned as challenges and future directions for this research field. Expectedly, this review offers professional and targeted guidelines for the rational design and practical application of TMP‐based HER catalysts.

Abstract
Electronic devices that can physically disappear in a controlled manner without harmful by‐products unveil a wide range of opportunities in medical devices, environmental monitoring, and next‐generation consumer electronics. Their property of transience is indispensable for mitigating the global problem of electronic waste accumulation. Additionally, transient technologies that are biocompatible and can be biologically resorbed are of great potential for applications in temporary medical implants, since it eliminates the need for expensive device recovery surgery. Transistors are the key building blocks of modern electronics, and their fabrication using organic materials is beneficial due to their low cost, unprecedented flexibility and facile processing. This contribution reviews the technological application of biodegradable materials in four major classes of organic transistors, namely organic field‐effect transistors (OFETs), organic synaptic transistors, electrolyte‐gated OFETs, and organic electrochemical transistors. The fundamental biodegradation mechanism is discussed in detail, followed by a perspective of various biodegradable materials utilized as active semiconductors, dielectrics, electrolytes and substrates in the various types of organic transistor devices. This contribution comprehensively discusses the role and application of biodegradable materials in all of the key modern‐day organic transistors, highlighting their unique properties that allow the fabrication of biodegradable, eco‐friendly, and sustainable devices.

      <title>Ultraductile Cementitious Structural Health Monitoring Coating: Waterborne Polymer Biomimetic Muscle and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane‐Assisted C‐S‐H Dispersion</title>
      <dc:description>
Long‐term and stable structural health monitoring (SHM) is an effective measure to solve the service issues of eroded concrete “quantitative evaluation of repair”. A series of novel solutions for crack resistance, toughening and monitoring‐durability improvement of cement‐based coating sensors based on organic‐inorganic hybrid technology is adopted, which provides a long‐term scheme for existing infrastructure SHM and its anti‐corrosive protection.








Abstract
Cement‐based sensors (CBSs) have demonstrated potential in structural health monitoring (SHM) despite rare applications due to their poor flexibility and sensing accuracy/protection with robustness. Herein, a promising strategy is reported to design a waterborne epoxy resin (WEP)‐modified cement‐based composite coating sensorcapable of simultaneous stable SHM and durable protection. The interpenetrating network (IPN) formed by WEP within cement paste is bionic to the toughness and crack resistance of biological muscle tissue and balances the ion permeation performance and polarization of hydration products. The polymerization‐redispersion progress and mechanism of calcium silicate hydrate (C‐S‐H) gel modified with [3‐(2‐aminoethylamino)‐propyl]trimethoxysilane silsesquioxane (C‐POSS) are characterized and revealed. The results show that the muscle‐like IPN increases the cement‐based coatings’ maximum deflection angle to 30° and improves the monitoring accuracy of compressive, tensile, and fatigue microchanges of concrete structures to more than 95%. The POSS···Ca2+···C‐S‐H interaction in C‐POSS partially transferred the intra‐adhesive hydrogen bonds surrounding the nanoconducer into electrostatic bridging ones to maintain an excellent electromechanical conductive dispersion.

      <dc:description>
Nanowires‐based optoelectronic synaptic devices are suitable for low power consumption neuromorphic applications due to their unique properties. Herein, the typical UV–vis–IR materials are summarized, and the current progress of nanowires‐based optoelectronic synaptic devices in UV–vis–IR spectral range is progressed, including the synaptic functionalities and neuromorphic applications. This review may promote nanowires for future multifunctional neuromorphic optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Simulating biological synaptic functionalities through artificial synaptic devices opens up an innovative way to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck at the device level. Artificial optoelectronic synapses provide a non‐contact method to operate the devices and overcome the shortcomings of electrical synaptic devices. With the advantages of high photoelectric conversion efficiency, adjustable light absorption coefficient, and broad spectral range, nanowires (NWs)‐based optoelectronic synapses have attracted wide attention. Herein, to better promote the applications of nanowires‐based optoelectronic synapses for future neuromorphic systems, the functionalities of optoelectronic synaptic devices and the current progress of NWs optoelectronic synaptic devices in UV–vis–IR spectral range are introduced. Furthermore, a bridge between NWs‐based optoelectronic synaptic device and the neuromorphic system is established.

      <title>A Soft, Fast and Versatile Electrohydraulic Gripper with Capacitive Object Size Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
This study presents a new type of electrohydraulic, multi‐material soft gripper that uses an active continuum structure simultaneously as an actuator and a sensor, allowing for grasp detection and object size estimation. The gripper is fast, modular, and robust; using only simple controls inputs it can grip a wide variety of objects, including delicate fruits, without inflicting damage.








Abstract
Soft robotic grippers achieve increased versatility and reduced complexity through intelligence embodied in their flexible and conformal structures. The most widely used soft grippers are pneumatically driven; they are simple and effective but require bulky air compressors that limit their application space and external sensors or computationally expensive vision systems for pick verification. In this study, a multi‐material architecture for self‐sensing electrohydraulic bending actuators is presented that enables a new class of highly versatile and reconfigurable soft grippers that are electrically driven and feature capacitive pick verification and object size detection. These electrohydraulic grippers are fast (step input results in finger closure in 50 ms), draw low power (6.5 mW per finger to hold grasp), and can pick a wide variety of objects with simple binary electrical control. Integrated high‐voltage driving electronics are presented that greatly increase the application space of the grippers and make them readily compatible with commercially available robotic arms.

      <title>Artificial Visual Systems With Tunable Photoconductivity Based on Organic Molecule‐Nanowire Heterojunctions</title>
      <dc:description>
The two different organic‐inorganic type‐I heterojunctions are fabricated with the InGaAs nanowire parallel arrays to realize the tunable persistent negative photoconductivity (NPC) or positive photoconductivity (PPC). The device arrays with multi‐wavelength NPC and PPC phenomena are adopted to build the hardware kernel for the visual system, which reaches a 100% recognition rate with lower complexity and power consumption.








Abstract
The visual system, one of the most crucial units of the human perception system, combines the functions of multi‐wavelength signal detection and data processing. Herein, the large‐scale artificial synaptic device arrays based on the organic molecule‐nanowire heterojunctions with tunable photoconductivity are proposed and demonstrated. The organic thin films of p‐type 2,7‐dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2‐b][1] benzothiophene (C8‐BTBT) or n‐type phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are used to wrap the InGaAs nanowire parallel arrays to configure two different type‐I heterojunctions, respectively. Due to the difference in carrier injection, persistent negative photoconductivity (NPC) or positive photoconductivity (PPC) are achieved in these heterojunctions. The irradiation with different wavelengths (solar‐blind to visible ranges) can stimulate the heterojunction devices, effectively mimicking the synaptic behaviors with two different photoconductivities. The long‐term and multi‐state light memory are also realized through synergistic photoelectric modulation. Notably, the arrays with different photoconductivities are adopted to build the hardware kernel for the visual system. Due to the tunable photoconductivity and response to multiple wavelengths, the recognition rate of neural networks can reach 100% with lower complexity and power consumption. Evidently, these photosynaptic devices are illustrated with retina‐like behaviors and capabilities for large‐area integration, which reveals their promising potential for artificial visual systems.

      <title>Determinant Role of Solution‐State Supramolecular Assembly in Molecular Orientation of Conjugated Polymer Films</title>
      <dc:description>
The possible origin of packing‐orientation formation in conjugated polymer films is unraveled. The solution‐state supramolecular structure of conjugated polymers, with the observation of reversible dimensionality transition, is found to play predominant roles in the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively.








Abstract
The solid‐state molecular orientation of conjugated polymers is of vital importance for their charge transport properties, where the edge‐on orientation with π‐stacking direction parallel to the surface is generally preferable to achieving high‐mobility planar field‐effect transistors. However, so far, little is known about the origin of packing‐orientation formation in thin films. Here, it is shown that the solution‐state supramolecular structure of widely studied PffBT4T‐based polymers can be reversibly tuned between 1D worm‐like and 2D lamellar structures for the same polymer/solvent system through solution temperature. Such dimensionality in solution determines the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively. More importantly, the transition temperature of solution‐state supramolecular dimensionality is in excellent agreement with that of solid‐state packing orientation. These experimental observations unambiguously demonstrate the predominant roles of solution‐state supramolecular assembly in solid‐state molecular orientation, which is further verified using different molecular weight batches and other two representative polymers. The findings provide new insights into the growth mechanism of polymer semiconductors during transistor fabrication, and open prospective pathways for boosting device performance of solution‐processable plastic electronics.

The possible origin of packing‐orientation formation in conjugated polymer films is unraveled. The solution‐state supramolecular structure of conjugated polymers, with the observation of reversible dimensionality transition, is found to play predominant roles in the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively.








Abstract
The solid‐state molecular orientation of conjugated polymers is of vital importance for their charge transport properties, where the edge‐on orientation with π‐stacking direction parallel to the surface is generally preferable to achieving high‐mobility planar field‐effect transistors. However, so far, little is known about the origin of packing‐orientation formation in thin films. Here, it is shown that the solution‐state supramolecular structure of widely studied PffBT4T‐based polymers can be reversibly tuned between 1D worm‐like and 2D lamellar structures for the same polymer/solvent system through solution temperature. Such dimensionality in solution determines the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively. More importantly, the transition temperature of solution‐state supramolecular dimensionality is in excellent agreement with that of solid‐state packing orientation. These experimental observations unambiguously demonstrate the predominant roles of solution‐state supramolecular assembly in solid‐state molecular orientation, which is further verified using different molecular weight batches and other two representative polymers. The findings provide new insights into the growth mechanism of polymer semiconductors during transistor fabrication, and open prospective pathways for boosting device performance of solution‐processable plastic electronics.

      <title>Biopolymer Nanovehicles for Oral Delivery of Natural Anticancer Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer is the second leading cause of death throughout the world. With the development of nano‐driven encapsulation strategies, polymeric vehicles, especially those with natural origins, have demonstrated a potent platform, which can professionally shield versatile nature‐inspired anticancer agents against gastrointestinal barricades and safely deliver them to the site of action.








Abstract
Cancer is the second leading cause of death throughout the world. Nature‐inspired anticancer agents (NAAs) that are a gift of nature to humanity have been extensively utilized in the alleviation/prevention of the disease due to their numerous pharmacological activities. While the oral route is an ideal and common way of drug administration, the application of NAAs through the oral pathway has been extremely limited owing to their inherent features, e.g., poor solubility, gastrointestinal (GI) instability, and low bioavailability. With the development of nano‐driven encapsulation strategies, polymeric vehicles, especially those with natural origins, have demonstrated a potent platform, which can professionally shield versatile NAAs against GI barricades and safely deliver them to the site of action. In this review, the predicament of orally delivering NAAs and the encapsulation strategy solutions based on biopolymer matrices are summarized. Proof‐of‐concept in vitro/in vivo results are also discussed for oral delivery of these agents by various biopolymer vehicles, which can be found so far from the literature. Last but not the least, the challenges and new opportunities in the field are highlighted.

      <title>Repair Strategies and Bioactive Functional Materials for Intervertebral Disc</title>
      <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and future prospects of repair strategies and materials for the intervertebral disc are reviewed, highlighting and summarizing the latest advances of main repairing strategies and functional materials for disc degeneration repair, to provide a reference for the following relevant studies.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the leading cause of low back pain, which represents a highly prevalent chronic aging‐associated disorder with a large socio‐economic burden and a great decline in the quality of life, contributing to the pressing need for IVD treatments. Thus, finding effective disease‐modifying approaches for postponing the progression of IVD degeneration and repairing degenerated intervertebral discs is of great importance, even facing various challengeable obstacles. Bioactive functional materials exhibit excellent advances in modulating cell activity and remodeling tissue homeostasis, which acts as a promising and accessible therapeutic approach to tissue repair and organ reconstruction. Recently, these have been notably explored to investigate bioactive functional materials‐based repair strategies for intervertebral disc recovery and regeneration, including cell‐based tissue engineering, the development of implants for disc recovery, and therapeutic methods for remodeling the functional integrity of the IVD. This review summarizes the advanced progress of bioactive functional materials in IVD repair and regeneration, and discusses their regulatory mechanisms, limitations, challenges as well as their clinical translational prospects in the future.

      <title>Interface Defects Tuning in Polymer‐Perovskite Phototransistors for Visual Synapse and Adaptation Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, a polymer‐perovskite layer heterointerface defects‐tuning strategy is proposed for realizing a novel bifunctional phototransistor. The prepared organic–inorganic hybrid phototransistors can perfectly mimic human visual synaptic behaviors with a quick response speed. More significantly, these devices also exhibit an obvious self‐adaptability toward wide‐ranging light stimuli and a unique desensitization characteristic to simulate the self‐protection behavior of human visual systems.








Abstract
Artificial sensory nerves can simulate the functions of visual perception and information processing of the human brain, which is indispensable for the immediate visualization of the environment and awareness requisite to avoid the potential harm. However, it still remains a long‐standing challenge to integrate recognition learning with real‐time processing function in a single device. Herein, an interface defects‐tuning strategy is proposed for developing a novel bi‐functional phototransistor. Benefiting from the tuned polymer‐perovskite layer‐heterointerface defects, the photogenerated charge trapping and de‐trapping capacities are significantly improved, thereby facilitating the photogenerated carrier separation and injection. The prepared organic‐inorganic hybrid phototransistors can perfectly mimic the human visual synaptic behaviors with a quick response speed (&lt;35 ms, far below that of human eyes to incident light (225 ms)). More importantly, the phototransistor exhibited obvious visual adaptation toward wide‐ranging light stimuli, and realized unique desensitization to simulate the self‐protection behavior of the human visual systems. Specifically, the adaptation timescales of the device under dim and high light conditions are superior to bio‐systems (&lt;2 min). Consequently, the reported strategy for the preparation of bi‐functional phototransistors provides a brand‐new perspective for next‐generation artificial nervous systems.

      <title>Physical Cue‐Based Strategies on Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
In this review, the physical cue‐based strategies, including electrical, acoustic, magnetic, and morphology, to the pathological improvement and regenerative licensing following peripheral nerve injury is systematically outlined. The typical studies are comprehensively summarized and dissected with an emphasis on their strategy conception and realization modalities and envision its prospects in the future.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) remains an intractable challenge in regenerative medicine. Recently, physical cue‐based strategies (e.g., electrical neurostimulation, acoustic radiation, electromagnetic bioregulation, as well as directional fiber guiding, etc.) have drawn increasing attention not only as a stimulator for cell functions modulation and fate determination, but also as a morphology‐index for modulating cell phenotype, proliferation, and differentiation, especially for nerve cells. More importantly, the advanced percutaneous power transmission technology, self‐power nanotechnology that leverages piezoelectrical/triboelectricity materials, and focused ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field technology exhibit the appealing practice potential for achieving low‐invasive, wireless, and battery‐free neuromodulation. In this review, recent advances of physical cue‐based strategies including electrical, acoustic, magnetic, and morphology for PNI are systematically overviewed, and the open challenges for realizing scalable clinical/commercial transformation and future perspectives of these strategies for PNI are concluded.

      <title>High‐Performance Phototransistor Based on Graphene/Organic Heterostructure for In‐Chip Visual Processing and Pulse Monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>
In this work, a graphene/bulk heterojunction phototransistor is presented for applications as photodetector, vision sensor, and pulse sensor for the first time. The phototransistor has a gate‐tunable bi‐directional photoresponse for in‐chip image processing. Moreover, the phototransistor can monitor human pulse signal and heart rate in real time. This work paves the way for the future development of multifunction artificial retinas.








Abstract
Mimicking the real‐time sensing and processing capabilities of human retina opens up a promising pathway for achieving vision chips with high‐efficient image processing. The development of retina‐inspired vision chip also requires hardware with high sensitivity, fast image capture, and the ability to sense under various lighting conditions. Herein, a high‐performance phototransistor based on graphene/organic heterojunction is demonstrated with a superior responsivity (2.86 × 106 A W−1), an outstanding respond speed (rise time/fall time is 20 µs/8.4 ms), and a remarkable detectivity (1.47 × 1014 Jones) at 650 nm. The phototransistor combines weak‐light detection capability (minimum detectable light intensity down to 2.8 nW cm−2) with gate‐tunable bi‐directional photoresponse capable of simultaneously sensing and processing visual images for light intensities ranging over six orders magnitude (10–107nW cm−2). Moreover, the phototransistor also exhibits an intriguing feature undiscovered in other retina‐inspired devices, namely that it can real‐time monitor the human pulse signal and heart rate by using photoplethysmography technology, and the measured heart rate error is only 0.87% compared with a commercially available sensor. This work paves the way for the development of low‐light and bio‐signal sensitive artificial retinas in the future.

      <dc:description>
The material characteristics, preparation methods, motion behaviors, and driving mechanisms of chemically driven micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are summarized in this review. A summary of current developments in chemically driven MNRs research is provided from the perspectives of drug delivery, disease diagnosis, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, gastrointestinal therapy, and cancer therapy. The MNRs’ biosafety characteristics for biological applications are outlined.








Abstract
Micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are capable of autonomous motion, breaking through the limitations of traditional passive transport of nanocarriers. Among them, chemically driven MNRs are the earliest MNRs studied and have received extensive attention from researchers. This review first focuses on the material properties, preparation, driving forms, and mechanisms of chemically driven MNRs. The current status of research on chemically driven MNRs in biomedicine is summarized for various biological applications (drug delivery, diagnostics, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, and disease treatment). In terms of biosafety, possible safety issues are analyzed in the context of chemically driven microrobotic applications in terms of three aspects: component characteristics, chemical engines and biological environment. Finally, the challenges and possible future directions of chemically driven MNRs are presented.

      <title>Flexible ZnO Nanosheet‐Based Artificial Synapses Prepared by Low‐Temperature Process for High Recognition Accuracy Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <dc:description>
The ZnO NS‐based artificial synapses are prepared at low temperature by a simple spin coating process. Combining various characterization techniques and data analysis, the weight transition process in artificial synapses is recognized, In addition, the typical synaptic plasticity and high recognition accuracy are realized and kept stable under a series of bending operations.








Abstract
In neuromorphic computing networks, a flexible synaptic memristor with high recognition accuracy is highly desired. In this study, ZnO nanosheets (ZnO NS) embedded within a polymethyl methacrylate host material are used as the intermediate layer to prepare flexible synaptic memristor at a low‐temperature of 80 °C. The device shows excellent switching characteristics with low SET/RESET voltages (−0.4 V/0.4 V) and stable retention characteristic (104 s). By modulating the conductance continuously, the flexible synaptic memristor simulates typical synaptic plasticities, including excitation post‐synaptic current, paired‐pulse facilitation, and spike‐timing dependent plasticity. Especially, the neuromorphic system built from flexible ZnO NS‐based memristors achieves a high recognition accuracy up to 97.7% for handwriting digit. Under the influence of 5% Uniform noise and 5% Gaussian noise, recognition accuracies are maintained at 94.6% and 93.7%, respectively. These properties are well maintained even when bending 1000 times at a radius of 5 mm. The flexible ZnO NS‐based memristor shows great prospects in wearable devices and neural morphology calculation.

      <title>Controlled Synthesis of Multicolor Carbon Dots Assisted by Machine Learning</title>
      <dc:description>
A data‐driven machine learning strategy is developed to efficiently and accurately guide the synthesis of multicolor CDs with excellent photoluminescence properties. The correlation between the reaction parameters and the photoluminescence properties of CDs is investigated.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received extensive attention and applications in recent years due to their remarkable characteristics of tunable emission wavelength, high stability, and a variety of synthetic raw materials. Since the formation process and photoluminescence properties of CDs are affected by multiple factors, the luminescence regulation of CDs has always been a troublesome problem. Furthermore, it is still a lack of appropriate approaches to reveal the hidden rules between the synthesis conditions and the luminescence properties of CDs. Inspired by machine learning (ML) applications in molecular and materials science, herein, a data‐driven ML strategy is proposed to multi‐dimensionally investigate the correlation between reaction parameters and the photoluminescence properties of CDs. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that reaction parameters and solvent properties have different influences on the fluorescence properties of CDs, and the intelligently optimizing synthesis route of CDs is achieved using ML algorithms. CDs with excellent luminescent properties screened by ML are further applied to high‐capacity colorful information encryption. This work provides an efficient ML‐assisted strategy to guide the synthesis of multicolor CDs, helping researchers to quickly and easily obtain CDs according to experimental requirements.

      <title>Bioinspired Machine‐Learning‐Assisted Early‐Fire Perception System Based on VO2 Optical Switch</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by brain‐centered perception processes, a machine‐learning‐assistant early fire perception system is demonstrated that can demodulate multiple fire signals and achieve early warning, fire cause identification, and evacuation advice provides. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first fire perception system featuring real‐time processing abilities with achieving early warning, fire cause identification, and evacuation advice provides.








Abstract
The continuation of human civilization has always been accompanied by symbiosis and confrontation with fire. Particularly, humans can comprehensively recognize fire situations based on various sensory receptors in organs (eyes, skin, nose, etc.), further forming a sound fire perception system by in‐the‐brain recording, modeling, and understanding fire behaviors, leading to the most accurate fire treatments. If a sensing perception system can mimic human perceptual behavior and carry out real‐time fire recognition, such an active defense system can achieve real fire safety. Here, inspired by the brain‐centered perception system, an early‐fire perception system enabled by a VO2‐based temperature‐flame‐modulated optical switch, and a machine‐learning‐assistant demodulation algorithm is reported. This approach creates real‐time monitoring composed of early fire warning (1 s for candle flame and 4 s for 130 °C heat flow), fire cause recognition (95.7% accuracy in identification), and evacuation advice provision, advancing the technologies in the perception system that enable future sensors the comprehensive perception capability for fire state.

      <title>Shape‐Deformable and Locomotive MXene (Ti3C2Tx)‐Encapsulated Magnetic Liquid Metal for 3D‐Motion‐Adaptive Synapses</title>
      <dc:description>
An Ti3C2Tx (MXene)‐encapsulated magnetic liquid metal (MX–MLM) is synthesized for application to 3D‐motion‐adaptive synapses. The MX–MLM exhibits magnetic‐field‐induced shape deformability, locomotion, self‐healability, recyclability, and nonwettability and has excellent potential for application to single‐neural‐network artificial‐intelligence‐based magnetic‐path‐tracking systems to simultaneously sense, learn, and adapt to different magnetic fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique surface chemistry, room‐temperature pseudoliquidity, and high electrical conductivity, gallium‐based liquid metals (LMs) exhibit multifunctionality. To grant deformable and self‐flowing characteristics to LMs, magnetic particles are incorporated for precisely controlling the LM motion and shape deformability. However, LM surface‐adhesion and corrosivity hinders the integration of LMs into complex circuits and devices owing to potential alloying with other metals and contamination of their surroundings. In this study, a highly conductive Ti3C2Tx (MXene)‐encapsulated magnetic LM (MX–MLM) is developed using a feasible fabrication method. The MX–MLM comprises magnetic particles suspended within its core and self‐assembled MXene flakes on the surface to maintain the nonwettability and high electrical conductivity of a liquid droplet. The noncorrosivity and increased magnetism of the MX–MLM enable nonstick magnetic‐field‐induced locomotion and shape deformation on various surfaces including metals, oxides, and polymers. Furthermore, the MX–MLM exhibits recyclability and magnetic‐field‐induced self‐healing. To demonstrate its functionality, the MX–MLM is employed as a magnetointeractive, shape‐deformable, and locomotive top gate electrode in a transistor fabricated using a ferroelectric polymer gate insulator. The device exhibits excellent magnetointeractive synaptic capability for detecting and learning 3D path information.

      <title>Self‐Steering Lasing System Enabled by Flexible Photo‐Actuators with Sandwich Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
A synergistic optically pumped strategy is demonstrated to realize self‐steering laser by using photo‐actuated free‐standing cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer‐based sandwich films. The flexible, portable, and durable laser with controllable beam steering and mechanical robustness, promise to open the door to autonomous vehicles, self‐sustaining machines, and optics with core features of optomechanical conversion.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of artificial intelligence, lasing with tailored features generated by photonic crystal (PhC) lasers has been playing a more important part in the optics field and in potential applications of self‐control, light detection and ranging, telecommunications, and holography imaging. As an information vehicle, the optical beam's maneuverability is influenced by the working wavelength, direction, and efficiency of the laser. Liquid crystal (LC)‐based mirrorless lasers are widely investigated in manipulating the tuning of emission wavelength. Realizing fast self‐steering of the laser beam to tune the emission direction is challenging because of the limitation on the complex and expensive inorganic fabrication and circuit design. In this work, a self‐steered lasing from a defect‐mode sandwich film composed of photomechanical deformable azobenzene cholesteric LC elastomer (CLCE) PhC layers and an isotropic gain interlayer is demonstrated. On the basis of the great light‐deformability of the CLCE, the output single‐mode lasing emission of the sandwich‐film laser can be steered quickly by UV irradiation in a wide angular tuning range of ≈±57°. This flexible, portable, and durable laser system with controllable beam‐steering and mechanical robustness is envisioned to open a gate for autonomous vehicles, self‐sustaining machines, and optical devices with the core feature of photomechanical conversion.

Inspired by these natural phenomena, a smart sensor is developed with a chiroptical 3D actuator that can fold, bend, and twist in response to external stimuli, reflecting light of specific wavelengths, and possessing circular polarization properties. Chirophotonic crystal actuators are constructed with an asymmetric Janus structure and are fabricated by self‐assembly, screen printing, and in situ photopolymerization. The optically active layer consists of cholesteric liquid crystal polymer, and the mechanically active layer is composed of a polymeric gel thin film. The programmed in‐planar and out‐of‐planar asymmetric Janus structures control the directionality of various shapes morphing from 2D to 3D. Finite element simulations allow to predict the shape changes associated with these chirophotonic crystal actuators: flower blooming, tendril climbing, eagle hunting, ant lifting, and inchworm moving motions. By utilizing the chirophotonic crystal actuator, a reusable and portable methanol‐laced water identifier is developed.

      <title>Fouling‐Proof Cooling (FP‐Cool) Fabric Hybrid with Enhanced Sweat‐Elimination and Heat‐Dissipation for Personal Thermal Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A fouling‐proof cooling (FP‐Cool) fabric that integrates with oil/water‐repellent and excellent passive cooling capacities is proposed by constructing superoleophobic Janus channels on heat‐conductive enhanced superomniphobic fabric. The FP‐Cool fabric preserves 40% higher thermal conductivity and over 50% higher evaporation rate than conventional fabrics. Moreover, the FP‐Cool keeps its anti‐fouling and sweat‐wicking/evaporation properties even after 3000 cycles of abrasion test.








Abstract
Passive cooling fabric that facilitates sweat‐wicking and evaporation is highly desirable for promoting human body's thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption. However, highly hydrophilic sweat‐wicking fabric fails to repel external fouling due to the contradiction between hydrophilicity and lyophobicity. Moreover, conventional passive cooling fabrics show limited evaporation capacity when they reach the adsorption limit in intense perspiration scenarios. Herein, a fouling‐proof cooling (FP‐Cool) fabric with an interactive functional structure design for highly‐efficient personal thermal regulation is proposed by constructing spatially distributed superoleophobic Janus channels on an optimized heat conductive superomniphobic fabric. The dominant superomniphobicity and superoleophobic Janus feature endow the outer FP‐Cool fabric with durable performance (up to 3000 cycles’ abrasion) to repel oil/water‐based contaminations. The Janus channels rapidly pull sweat out of the inner fabric for efficient evaporation, ensuring a dry sense of skin. The FP‐Cool fabric preserves 40% higher thermal conductivity, and over 50% higher evaporation rate than conventional fabrics. In the sweat evaporation test, the FP‐Cool fabric shows up to 100% reduction in sweat gain ratio to cotton fabric. The concept would have implications for intelligent textiles design, and the synthesis strategy can be applied in various applications such as oil‐water separation and microfluidics control.

      <title>3D Printable One‐Part Carbon Nanotube‐Elastomer Ink for Health Monitoring Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel 3D printable one‐part carbon nanotube‐silicone ink is constructed through a room‐temperature process. The ink is highly versatile as a 3D printable nanocomposite, capable of forming flexible, stretchable, self‐supporting, and high‐aspect‐ratio structures. Patient‐tailored prints with ≈100 µm resolution are printed on both polar and nonpolar substrates, paving the way for next‐generation motion detection and health monitoring devices.








Abstract
3D printing of conductive elastomers is a promising route to personalized health monitoring applications due to its flexibility and biocompatibility. Here, a one‐part, highly conductive, flexible, stretchable, 3D printable carbon nanotube (CNT)‐silicone composite is developed and thoroughly characterized. The one‐part nature of the inks: i) enables printing without prior mixing and cures under ambient conditions; ii) allows direct dispensing at ≈100 µm resolution printability on nonpolar and polar substrates; iii) forms both self‐supporting and high‐aspect‐ratio structures, key aspects in additive biomanufacturing that eliminate the need for sacrificial layers; and iv) lends efficient, reproducible, and highly sensitive responses to various tensile and compressive stimuli. The high electrical and thermal conductivity of the CNT‐silicone composite is further extended to facilitate use as a flexible and stretchable heating element, with applications in body temperature regulation, water distillation, and dual temperature sensing and Joule heating. Overall, the facile fabrication of this composite points to excellent synergy with direct ink writing and can be used to prepare patient‐specific wearable electronics for motion detection and cardiac and respiratory monitoring devices and toward advanced personal health tracking and bionic skin applications.

      <title>Air Permeable Vibrotactile Actuators for Wearable Wireless Haptics</title>
      <dc:description>
An air permeable vibrotactile actuator achieves excellent air permeability of 108 L m−2 s−1, low preload requirement of 10 mN, high output sensitivity of 0.2 mN V−1, and good mechanical durability by surviving 11 million testing cycles. A wearable wireless haptic feedback system is developed for transmitting haptic information to different parts of human body in real time, such as finger and chest.








Abstract
Vibrotactile actuators can evoke mechanical stimulations on human skins to induce haptic feedbacks for various human machine interaction applications. However, efforts toward their practical usages encounter several engineering challenges, including wearable comfortability and output abilities. Here, air permeable actuators are developed and embedded in common fabrics for vibrotactile actuation, achieving excellent air permeability of 108 L m−2 s−1, low preload requirement of 10 mN, high output sensitivity of 0.2 mN/V, and good mechanical durability by surviving 11 million testing cycles. As demonstration examples, a wireless haptic feedback glove is shown to distinguish 32 different English characters and symbols with an overall accuracy of 97.8%, and large size actuators (10 × 10 cm2) are also proved for providing haptic feedback for parts of human body. As such, the proposed system opens a new class of wearable vibrotactile actuators for potential applications in wide fields of metaverse, teleoperation, smart textiles, and robotics.

      <title>Biotissue‐Inspired Anisotropic Carbon Fiber Composite Hydrogels for Logic Gates, Integrated Soft Actuators, and Sensors with Ultra‐High Sensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Bio‐inspired anisotropic hydrogels are synthesized by compositing aligned carbon fibers with thermo‐responsive networks. The gels show extremely high anisotropy in modulus, conductivity and sensitivity, and find new use as logic gates. Compositing pre‐twisted carbon fibers with thermo‐responsive network generates 4D helical actuators that sense their own actuations. It shows a promise for human–machine interfacing and soft robots with integrated feedback loop.








Abstract
Natural biotissues like muscles, ligaments, and nerves have highly aligned structures, which play critical roles in directional signal transport, sensing, and actuation. Inspired by anisotropic biotissues, composite hydrogels with outstanding mechanical properties and conductivity are developed by compositing thermo‐responsive poly (N‐isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels with highly aligned carbon fibers (CFs). The anisotropic hydrogels show superior tensile strength (3.0 ± 0.3), modulus (74 ± 7.0 MPa), excellent electrical conductivity (≈670 S m−1), and ultra‐high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 647) along CFs, with an anisotropic ratio (AR) up to 740 over those in perpendicular direction. The extremely high AR in conductivity (more than 400) produces high‐level output in parallel direction and low‐level output in perpendicular direction with a direct current (DC) power supply, which is used to fabricate AND and OR gates. Moreover, the composite hydrogels are converted into thermo‐responsive actuators with CFs twisted before compositing with PNIPAM/clay network. The pre‐twisted CF helices impart internal stress that drives reversible actuation of hydrogel helices upon thermo‐stimulating. The actuation is self‐sensed due to the extremely high sensitivity of the composite hydrogels. Such biomimetic anisotropic self‐sensing hydrogel actuators resemble natural biotissues with both actuation and sensing capabilities, and have promise applications for artificial robotics.

Abstract
Post‐pandemic era poses an imperative demand on progressive sensing devices whose performance largely relies on the morphologies and structures of sensing materials. Despite substantial efforts and advances that have been made in sensing materials with different micro/nanoscale dimensionalities, it is still challenging to couple micro/nano platforms with sensing materials together for the precise and scalable production of high‐performance sensors toward practical application scenarios. Owing to noncontact, precise, and high‐efficiency features, laser micro/nanofabrication offers a promising solution to achieve high‐quality micro/nano sensors with novel functionalities in a relatively short time. Herein, this review begins with a glance over the development of micro/nano‐structured sensors and briefly discusses the importance of laser micro/nanostructuring technology for micro/nano‐engineering of the sensors. Next, representative processing methods are elaborated in detail from a laser‐pulse‐type point of view, with potential applications toward chemical, physical, and biological targets based on different sensing mechanisms summarized. Finally, the perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of laser micro/nanostructuring strategies and materials for micro/nanosensors are presented.

      <title>Marine‐Derived Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Classifications and functional properties of marine‐derived hydrogels as well as the impact of physicochemical properties in preparing biomaterials, from collagen to alginate, hyaluronic acid, chitosan and so on are illustrated. Advanced strategies for accurate fabrication of three‐dimensional biomaterials are then summarized by employing marine‐derived hydrogel and also their further biomedical applications.








Abstract
Marine organisms provide novel and broad sources for the preparations and applications of biomaterials. Since the urgent requirement of bio‐hydrogels to mimic tissue extracellular matrix (ECM), the natural biomacromolecule hydrogels derived from marine sources have received increasing attention. Benefiting from their outstanding bioactivity and biocompatibility, many attempts have been made to reconstruct ECM components by applying marine‐derived natural hydrogels. Moreover, marine hydrogels have been successfully applied in biomedicine by means of microfluidics, electrospray, and bioprinting. In this review, the classification and characteristics of marine‐derived hydrogels are summarized. In particular, their role in the development of biomaterials is also introduced. Then, we focus on the recent advances in bio‐fabrication strategies for various hydrogel materials. Besides, the influences of hydrogel types on their functions in biomedical applications are discussed in depth. Finally, critical reflections on the limitations and future development of marine‐derived hydrogels are presented.

Classifications and functional properties of marine‐derived hydrogels as well as the impact of physicochemical properties in preparing biomaterials, from collagen to alginate, hyaluronic acid, chitosan and so on are illustrated. Advanced strategies for accurate fabrication of three‐dimensional biomaterials are then summarized by employing marine‐derived hydrogel and also their further biomedical applications.








Abstract
Marine organisms provide novel and broad sources for the preparations and applications of biomaterials. Since the urgent requirement of bio‐hydrogels to mimic tissue extracellular matrix (ECM), the natural biomacromolecule hydrogels derived from marine sources have received increasing attention. Benefiting from their outstanding bioactivity and biocompatibility, many attempts have been made to reconstruct ECM components by applying marine‐derived natural hydrogels. Moreover, marine hydrogels have been successfully applied in biomedicine by means of microfluidics, electrospray, and bioprinting. In this review, the classification and characteristics of marine‐derived hydrogels are summarized. In particular, their role in the development of biomaterials is also introduced. Then, we focus on the recent advances in bio‐fabrication strategies for various hydrogel materials. Besides, the influences of hydrogel types on their functions in biomedical applications are discussed in depth. Finally, critical reflections on the limitations and future development of marine‐derived hydrogels are presented.

      <title>A Versatile Ionomer‐Based Soft Actuator with Multi‐Stimulus Responses, Self‐Sustainable Locomotion, and Photoelectric Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile intelligent actuator is constructed, exhibiting large deformation with various forms and high stability, responding to sunlight, electricity, and humidity/solvent change. Its reaction under natural environmental change is further demonstrated in prototypes including 1) a sustainable robot with adjustable photophobic/phototropic locomotion as well as adaptive marching ability, 2) a solar‐electric generator, and 3) bionic flowers interact with environmental changes.








Abstract
The prospects of endowing artificial robotics or devices with increasingly complex and emergent life‐like behaviors have attracted growing interest in the soft functional materials that mimic the versatile motions of living creatures in the iridescent nature. However, despite the flourishing achievements so far, soft actuators capable of sensitive multi‐stimulus responses and self‐sustainable movements, have been extensively pursued to reduce control complexity yet remains a challenging target. Here, through material‐structural synergistic design incorporating stress‐mismatching structure, high pseudo‐negative coefficient of thermal expansion of perfluoro‐sulfonic acid ionomer, comprehensive converting properties of carbon nanotube, and anisotropic large thermal expansion of PE polymer, an ionomer‐based bilayer actuator is proposed, presenting high‐performance actuation of various forms and nice stability, responsive to light (including sunlight without focusing, LED light), low voltage, mild heating, and humidity/solvent change. With a built‐in structural feedback loop, the actuation performances are further explored to realize intelligent systems, including: 1) self‐sustainable locomotion under sunlight irradiation with adjustable photophobic and phototropic direction as well as adaption to different topographies and loading conditions, 2) self‐sustainable oscillation and solar‐electric generating, and 3) bionic floristic reaction according to environmental change. These diversified actuation modes allow promising following‐up designs for bio‐hybrid soft robotics fueled by and harmonized with natural environments.

      <title>Alternating Growth for InSitu Post‐Programing Hydrogels’ Sizes and Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Acid–base complex hydrogels made of acidic (A) and basic (B) monomers can continuously integrate their parent monomers to grow, which leads to tunable size, shape, composition, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Growing polymer materials emerge as a class of new intelligent systems, but they are all covalently cross‐linked. Herein, an alternating growth strategy for enabling tough supramolecular hydrogels is described to integrate externally provided compounds to change their sizes, geometric shapes, mechanical properties, etc. The hydrogels have dynamic acid–base complex (ABC) structures made from acidic and basic monomers, in which the acid–base pairs equilibrate between ionic and nonionic states to show either strong electrostatic or weak acid–base interactions. The growth process includes swelling of acidic/basic monomers, polymerization of the absorbed monomers, and homogenization of the original and newborn polymers, in which the balance between electrostatic and acid–base interactions is reversibly shifted to enable the process. As a result of such repeatable growth cycles, the hydrogels can continuously expand without compromising material mechanical properties. The growing sub‐processes and the monomer compositions can be used to post‐modulate the structure and properties of the grown products. It is demonstrated that the hydrogels may be designed as artificial tissues capable of growth under force‐bearing states.

      <title>Within or Without You? A Perspective Comparing In Situ and Ex Situ Tissue Engineering Strategies for Articular Cartilage Repair</title>
      <dc:description>
This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art of bioengineering for articular cartilage. Here the intricacies of articular cartilage bioengineering are described, exploring in depth the advances and disadvantages of two strategies of delivering stem cell based approaches, namely, the direct “in situ” delivery and the more traditional bench‐based strategy.








Abstract
Human articular cartilage has a poor ability to self‐repair, meaning small injuries often lead to osteoarthritis, a painful and debilitating condition which is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Existing clinical strategies generally do not regenerate hyaline type cartilage, motivating research toward tissue engineering solutions. Prospective cartilage tissue engineering therapies can be placed into two broad categories: i) Ex situ strategies, where cartilage tissue constructs are engineered in the lab prior to implantation and ii) in situ strategies, where cells and/or a bioscaffold are delivered to the defect site to stimulate chondral repair directly. While commonalities exist between these two approaches, the core point of distinction—whether chondrogenesis primarily occurs “within” or “without” (outside) the body—can dictate many aspects of the treatment. This difference influences decisions around cell selection, the biomaterials formulation and the surgical implantation procedure, the processes of tissue integration and maturation, as well as, the prospects for regulatory clearance and clinical translation. Here, ex situ and in situ cartilage engineering strategies are compared: Highlighting their respective challenges, opportunities, and prospects on their translational pathways toward long term human cartilage repair.

      <title>Shining a Light on Cancer—Photonics in Microfluidic Tumor Modeling and Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>
In this paper, Guimarães et al. review light‐driven technologies in microfluidic cancer models. Starting with an overview of how light can aid in the assembly and fabrication of cancer microarchitectures, the authors then look to the role of photonics in the quantification of cancer responses and markers from a biosensing perspective, with a focus in microfluidic platforms.








Abstract
Microfluidic platforms represent a powerful approach to miniaturizing important characteristics of cancers, improving in vitro testing by increasing physiological relevance. Different tools can manipulate cells and materials at the microscale, but few offer the efficiency and versatility of light and optical technologies. Moreover, light‐driven technologies englobe a broad toolbox for quantifying critical biological phenomena. Herein, the role of photonics in microfluidic 3D cancer modeling and biosensing from three major perspectives is reviewed. First, optical‐driven technologies are looked upon, as these allow biomaterials and living cells to be manipulated with microsized precision and present opportunities to advance 3D microfluidic models by engineering cancer microenvironments' hallmarks, such as their architecture, cellular complexity, and vascularization. Second, the growing field of optofluidics is discussed, exploring how optical tools can directly interface microfluidic chips, enabling the extraction of relevant biological data, from single fluorescent signals to the complete 3D imaging of diseased cells within microchannels. Third, advances in optical cancer biosensing are reviewed, focusing on how light–matter interactions can detect biomarkers, rare circulating tumor cells, and cell‐derived structures such as exosomes. Photonic technologies' current challenges and caveats in microfluidic 3D cancer models are overviewed, outlining future research avenues that may catapult the field.

      <title>Catalytic Biomaterials and Nanomedicines with Exogenous and Endogenous Activations</title>
      <dc:description>
The state‐of‐the‐art advances in the development and use of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines in different biomedical applications are systematically summarized, concentrating on endogenous activators, exogenous stimuli, and the integration of endogenous and exogenous triggers to augment the efficacy of biomaterial‐ or nanomedicine‐enabled catalytic treatments. Their biosafety profiles and the challenges in their clinical application are discussed.








Abstract
Catalytic therapy can concurrently enhance therapeutic efficacy and decrease side effects by converting less toxic or nontoxic endogenous substances into various highly toxic reactive species (e.g., toxic radicals) to induce cell apoptosis/necrosis, which has been exploited to combat different types of diseases. As material science and nanotechnology evolve for application in disease therapies, a variety of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines have been elaborately designed and synthesized to mediate catalytic reactions and/or enhance the corresponding catalytic treatment efficacy. This review systematically summarizes, outlines, and discusses the state‐of‐the‐art advances in the development and use of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines in diverse biomedical applications, particularly concentrating on their endogenous activators, exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, heat, ultrasound, and magnetic field), and the integration of endogenous and exogenous triggers to improve the efficacy of biomaterial/nanomedicine‐enabled catalytic treatments. The biosafety and biocompatibility of various catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines for biomedical applications are also discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for advancement of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines are highlighted, aiming to boost their early fulfillment of practical clinical applications.

      <title>Wearable Hydrogel‐Based Epidermal Sensor with Thermal Compatibility and Long Term Stability for Smart Colorimetric Multi‐Signals Monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, wearable transparent epidermal sensors with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring are successfully developed. These freestanding wearable epidermal sensors are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner.








Abstract
Hydrogel‐based wearable epidermal sensors (HWESs) have attracted widespread attention in health monitoring, especially considering their colorimetric readout capability. However, it remains challenging for HWESs to work at extreme temperatures with long term stability due to the existence of water. Herein, a wearable transparent epidermal sensor with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring is developed, based on an anti‐freezing and anti‐drying hydrogel with high transparency (over 90% transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1500%) and desirable adhesiveness to various kinds of substrates. The hydrogel consists of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and tannic acid‐coated cellulose nanocrystals in glycerin/water binary solvents. When glycerin readily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, the hydrogel exhibits outstanding thermal compatibility. Furthermore, the hydrogel maintains excellent adhesion, stretchability, and transparency after long term storage (45 days) or at subzero temperatures (−20 °C). For smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring, the freestanding smart colorimetric HWESs are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner. In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi‐signals with visible readouts in long term health monitoring.

In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi‐signals with visible readouts in long term health monitoring.

      <title>3D‐Printed Radiopaque Microdevices with Enhanced Mucoadhesive Geometry for Oral Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, this study demonstrates how an innovative high definition digital versatile disc based microscale 3D printing setup can be used to fabricate versatile microdevices, with adhering geometric structures and incorporated contrast agent, for oral drug delivery. Generally, the presented fabrication process improves mucoadhesion and traceability of microdevices used for oral drug delivery.








Abstract
During the past decades, microdevices have been evaluated as a means to overcome challenges within oral drug delivery, thus improving bioavailability. Fabrication of microdevices is often limited to planar or simple 3D designs. Therefore, this work explores how microscale stereolithography 3D printing can be used to fabricate radiopaque microcontainers with enhanced mucoadhesive geometries, which can enhance bioavailability by increasing gastrointestinal retention. Ex vivo force measurements suggest increased mucoadhesion of microcontainers with adhering features, such as pillars and arrows, compared to a neutral design. In vivo studies, utilizing planar X‐ray imaging, show the time‐dependent gastrointestinal location of microcontainers, whereas computed tomography scanning and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy reveal information about their spatial dynamics and mucosal interactions, respectively. For the first time, the effect of 3D microdevice modifications on gastrointestinal retention is traced in vivo, and the applied methods provide a much‐needed approach for investigating the impact of device design on gastrointestinal retention.

      <title>Research Progress of Shape Memory Polymer and 4D Printing in Biomedical Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
As a kind of smart material, shape memory polymer (SMP) shows great application potential in the biomedical field. Compared with traditional metal‐based medical devices, SMP‐based devices have the following characteristics: (1) The adaptive ability allows the biomedical device to better match the surrounding tissue after being implanted into the body by minimally invasive implantation; (2) It has better biocompatibility and adjustable biodegradability; (3) Mechanical properties can be regulated in a large range to better match with the surrounding tissue. 4D printing technology is a comprehensive technology based on smart materials and 3D printing, which has great application value in the biomedical field. 4D printing technology breaks through the technical bottleneck of personalized customization and provides a new opportunity for the further development of the biomedical field. This paper summarizes the application of SMP and 4D printing technology in the field of bone tissue scaffolds, tracheal scaffolds, and drug release, etc. Moreover, this paper analyzes the existing problems and prospects, hoping to provide a preliminary discussion and useful reference for the application of SMP in biomedical engineering.

      <title>Selective Formation of Osteogenic and Vasculogenic Tissues for Cartilage Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrodeposition strategy is reported, which enables the selective formation of tissue‐engineered periosteum substitutes with osteoprogenitor and vascular niche in the multiphasic scaffold in combination with different human cell types for articular cartilage regeneration in an orthotopic in vivo platform.








Abstract
Tissue‐engineered periosteum substitutes (TEPSs) incorporating hierarchical architecture with osteoprogenitor and vascular niches are drawing much attention as a promising tool to support functional cells in defined zones and nourish the cortical bone. Current TEPSs usually lack technologies to closely observe cell performance, especially at the cell contact interface between distinct compartments containing defined biological configurations and functions. Here, an electrodeposition strategy is reported, which enables the selective formation of TEPSs with osteoprogenitor and vascular niches in a multiphasic scaffold in combination with different human cell types for cartilage regeneration in an in vivo osteochondral defect model. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are used to mirror both the vascular and osteogenic niches, respectively. It is observed that the intrinsic viscoelastic nature of the porous solid matrix is essential to successfully induce angiogenesis. Coculture of hMSCs with functional cells (HUVECs/HDFs) in TEPSs also effectively promoted periosteal regeneration, including osteogenic and angiogenic processes. The osteoarthritis cartilage histopathology assessment and histologic/histochemical grading system data indicate that the TEPSs containing hMSCs/HUVECs/HDFs exhibit superior potential for cartilage regeneration.

      <title>A Review of Recent Progress on Collagen‐Based Biomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Collagen‐based biomaterials (CBBs) have been confirmed to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue‐engineered scaffolds, etc. This review, combined with the situation in China, provides thorough strides in CBBs structures, cross‐linking, forming technologies, real‐world applications, and the underlying development directions, which is beneficial for the exploration of the development strategy, and international reach of China's collagen industry.








Abstract
Since the 2010s, the demand for healthcare models has exceeded the prevailing resources available due to the rapid increase in the aging population in China. However, a significant gap in development of biomedical materials remains, especially between China and the western developed countries. Collagen is the major protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been extensively applied in medical fields. Collagen‐based biomaterials (CBBs) are used to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue‐engineered scaffolds, and drug delivery systems; this is attributed to their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, hypoimmunogenicity, and coordination between collagen hosts and tissues. This review provides thorough strides in CBB structures, crosslinking and forming technologies, and real‐world applications. First, the natural origin and specific structures of animal‐derived collagen and non‐animal‐derived collagen are introduced and compared. Second, crosslinking methods and forming technologies of CBBs across the board are discussed. Third, several examples are considered to demonstrate the practical biomedical use of CBBs and highlight cautionary notes. Finally, the underlying development directions of CBBs from an interdisciplinary perspective are outlined. This review aims to provide comprehensive mechanisms by which collagen can be uniquely and practically used as advanced biomaterial, hence providing options for augmenting its development in China.

      <title>Smart Nanoparticle‐based Platforms for Regulating Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The tumor development and metastasis are closely related to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, several studies have indicated that modulating TME could enhance cancer immunotherapy. Among various approaches to modulating TME, nanoparticles (NPs) with unique inherent advantages and smart modified characteristics are promising candidates in delivering drugs to cancer cells, amplifying the therapeutic effects, and leading to a cascade of immune responses. In this review, we briefly introduce several smart NP‐based platforms, such as responsive NPs, targeting NPs, and the composition of TME, including dendritic cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, myeloid‐derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells. Moreover, the recent applications of smart NP‐based platforms in regulating TME and cancer immunotherapy are briefly introduced. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these smart NP‐based platforms in potential clinical translation.

      <title>Nanostructured‐Based optical readouts Interfaced with machine learning for identification of extracellular vesicles</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are shed from cancer cells into body fluids, enclosing molecular information about the underlying disease with the potential for being the target cancer biomarker in emerging diagnosis approaches such as liquid biopsy. Still, the study of EVs presents major challenges due to their heterogeneity, complexity, and scarcity. Recently, liquid biopsy platforms have allowed the study of tumor‐derived materials, holding great promise for early‐stage diagnosis and monitoring of cancer when interfaced with novel adaptations of optical readouts and advanced machine learning analysis. Here, we review recent advances in labeled and label‐free optical techniques such as fluorescence, plasmonic, and chromogenic‐based systems interfaced with nanostructured sensors like nanoparticles, nanoholes, and nanowires and diverse machine learning analysis. We compare the adaptability of the different optical methods discussed and provide insights into prospective avenues for the translation of the technological approaches for cancer diagnosis. We discuss that the inherent augmented properties of nanostructures enhance the sensitivity of the detection of EVs. We conclude by reviewing recent integrations of nanostructured based optical readouts with diverse machine learning models as novel analysis ventures that can potentially increase the capability of the methods to the point of translation into diagnostic applications.

      <title>Patterned Duplex Fabric Based on Genetically Modified Spidroin for Smart Wound Management</title>
      <dc:description>
A smart patterned DNA double helix (duplex) fabric based on transgenic spider silk protein (PDF‐S) for the treatment of diabetic wounds, is proposed. PDF‐S is equipped with high strength, toughness, and conductivity, enabling sensitive motion monitoring. Meanwhile, PDF‐S has good biocompatibility, and can perform microfluidic control on wound interstitial fluid, and finally perform wound immunoassay.








Abstract
The treatment of diabetic wounds remains a great challenge for the medical community. Here, a smart patterned DNA double helix (duplex)‐like fabric based on genetically modified spider silk protein (PDF‐S) which is inspired by soft plant tendrils, is proposed for diabetic wound treatment. Benefiting from spider silk protein (spidroin); PDF‐S is equipped with high strength; high toughness, and excellent biocompatibility. Notably, the fabric crimped through the biomimetic DNA double‐helix‐like structure can effectively adapt to tensile impact and the maximum stretch rate reaches 1500%. A pattern‐based microfluidic channel of PDF‐S allowed wound secretion to flow spontaneously through the channel. Meanwhile; due to the optical properties of the introduced photonic crystal structure; PDF‐S is equipped with fluorescence enhancement properties; enabling PDF‐S to display color‐sensitive behavior suitable for wound monitoring and guiding clinical treatment. In addition, to enable sensitive motion monitoring, microelectronic circuits are integrated on the surface of the PDF‐S. These unique material features suggest that this study will lead to a new generation of biomimetic artificial spider silk materials for design and application in the biomedical field.

Notably, the fabric crimped through the biomimetic DNA double‐helix‐like structure can effectively adapt to tensile impact and the maximum stretch rate reaches 1500%. A pattern‐based microfluidic channel of PDF‐S allowed wound secretion to flow spontaneously through the channel. Meanwhile; due to the optical properties of the introduced photonic crystal structure; PDF‐S is equipped with fluorescence enhancement properties; enabling PDF‐S to display color‐sensitive behavior suitable for wound monitoring and guiding clinical treatment. In addition, to enable sensitive motion monitoring, microelectronic circuits are integrated on the surface of the PDF‐S. These unique material features suggest that this study will lead to a new generation of biomimetic artificial spider silk materials for design and application in the biomedical field.

      <title>LBL Noninvasively Peelable Biointerfacial Adhesives for Cutaneo‐Inspired pH/Tactility Artificial Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Advanced human skin‐mimicking devices remain challenging because of inherent complex physiological structures and functions. A pH/tactility dual‐sensing layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly film patch can monitor real‐time pH and contact injury well, sending immediate feedback of red, green, and blue (RGB) values and self‐powered current signals to an app. This patch with post‐adhesion removal‐on‐demand and post‐damage self‐healing properties features skin‐inspired receptors for digital healthcare.








Abstract
Besides barrier functions, skin possesses multiple sentiences to external stimuli (e.g., temperature, force, and humidity) for human‐outside interaction. Thus, skincare should be taken very seriously, especially by patients with sensory disorders. However, currently available skin‐mimicking devices are always limited by so much insufficient response functions and nontunable interface behaviors so as not to realize precise health monitoring and self‐defense against injury. Herein, a bioinspired cutaneous receptor‐perceptual system (CRPS) patch is presented, integrating hybrid pH indicators and triboelectric nanogenerators into biointerface film‐adhesives that are fabricated through facile layer‐by‐layer (LBL) self‐assembly of amide and Schiff‐base linkages between alginate grafted with N‐hydroxysuccinimide ester (AN), tannic acid (TA), and polyethylenimine (PEI). This CRPS patch is adhered robustly to the soft‐curved skin surface without failure via “molecular suturing,” and amino acid enables its benign peel‐on‐demand from tissue interfaces. Postdamage self‐healing brings it without surgical reoperation, avoiding extra cost, pain, as well as infection risks. Significantly, CRPS patches as artificial chemo/mechanoreceptors can remotely visualize skin physiological status by pH‐induced chromism using smartphones and prevent skin contact injury by tactility‐driven self‐powered electrical signals. Overall, the LBL‐based strategy to create controllably biointerface‐adhesive CRPS patches will usher in a new era of the mobihealth care platform supporting smart diagnosis and self‐protection.

      <title>Advances in Lipid‐Based Co‐delivery Systems for Cancer and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Combination therapy targeting multiple therapeutic targets is a favorable strategy to achieve better therapeutic outcomes in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Co‐delivery is a subfield of drug delivery that aims to achieve combined delivery of diverse therapeutic cargoes within the same delivery system, thereby ensuring delivery to the same site and providing an opportunity to tailor the release kinetics as desired. Amongst the wide range of materials being investigated in the design of co‐delivery systems, lipids have stood out on account of their low toxicity, biocompatibility, and ease of formulation scale‐up. This review highlights the advances of the last decade in lipid‐based co‐delivery systems focusing on the co‐delivery of drug‐drug, drug‐nucleic acid, nucleic acid‐nucleic acid, and protein therapeutic based combinations for targeted therapy in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

      <title>Chirality in Light–Matter Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in nanofabricated optical metamaterials designed to enhance the interaction between optical and structural chirality are explored, focusing on the role of chirality in biological systems and its use in current biosensing applications. Additionally, the recent introduction of machine‐learning algorithms to the design of chiral nanophotonic structures is discussed.








Abstract
The scientific effort to control the interaction between light and matter has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades. This growth has been aided by the development of scientific and technological tools enabling the manipulation of light at deeply sub‐wavelength scales, unlocking a large variety of novel phenomena spanning traditionally distant research areas. Here, the role of chirality in light–matter interactions is reviewed by providing a broad overview of its properties, materials, and applications. A perspective on future developments is highlighted, including the growing role of machine learning in designing advanced chiroptical materials to enhance and control light–matter interactions across several scales.

      <title>Strain Engineering of Low‐Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain‐tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low‐dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain‐quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic‐angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron–electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain‐tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low‐dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain‐quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many‐body interactions and holds substantial promise for next‐generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

      <title>A Meta‐Device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by the magic stairs, an innovative and complementary integration of light‐field and structured‐light depth mapping and imaging system using a size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 meta‐lens array to measure the depth over a 30 cm range is shown. This compact, lightweight, low power consumption system can be used for autonomous systems in all light levels conditions.








Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth‐sensing due to the limited and specific light‐field information acquired by single‐lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, an intelligent and compact depth‐sensing meta‐device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels is demonstrated. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta‐lenses and a size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30 cm range with deep‐learning support. The meta‐lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta‐lens array can serve as the core functional component of a light‐field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured‐light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human–computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

      <title>Machine Learning for Optical Scanning Probe Nanoscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Three main paradigms of machine learning—supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning—can be applied to optical scanning probe techniques in future instrumentation and data analysis to solve unique problems.








Abstract
The ability to perform nanometer‐scale optical imaging and spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low‐energy effects in quantum materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological samples. These tasks can be accomplished by the scattering‐type scanning near‐field optical microscopy (s‐SNOM) technique that has recently spread to many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. Herein, it is shown that the s‐SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in many ways from artificial‐intelligence (AI) and machine‐learning (ML) algorithms. Augmented with AI‐ and ML‐enhanced data acquisition and analysis, scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate, and intelligent.

      <title>Quantum‐Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next‐Generation Information Processing and Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices—from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin‐FETs, valley‐FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra‐energy‐efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid‐state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy‐efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band‐to‐band tunneling, spin–orbit coupling, spin–valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low‐dimensional and manufacture‐friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum‐engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum‐engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy‐efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D‐material scientists are provided.

      <title>Metasurface‐Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurface‐enhanced infrared spectroscopy has emerged as a highly sensitive tool for detecting and monitoring the constituents of molecular systems. This review showcases a variety of metaresonator sensors based on different resonance principles, geometries, and materials. The unique functionalities they offer for molecular studies, including dielectrophoresis‐based cell trapping and sensing, as well as AI‐augmented monitoring of biomolecular systems are discussed.








Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label‐free, noninvasive, and real‐time detection, infrared spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough applications for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far‐field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot‐spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light–matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface‐enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface‐enhanced infrared spectroscopy, a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials, and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices is showcased, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab‐on‐a‐chip devices. Furthermore, advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface‐based infrared spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine‐learning‐aided analysis are highlighted.

      <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti‐counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.








Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli‐responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state‐of‐the‐art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti‐counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next‐generation photonic materials.

      <title>Roles of MXene in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design, and Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
2D layered nanosheet MXene has been widely studied in pressure sensing due to the excellent mechanical and electrical properties, outstanding hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. To further promote the application of MXene in pressure sensors, the preparation of MXene, MXene‐based microstructures, MXene pressure‐sensor mechanisms, and the integration of multiple devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e‐skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red‐hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand‐new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e‐skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene‐based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e‐skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

      <title>Flexible Metamaterial Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest progress of novel flexible electronics with enhancing and innovating properties and functionalities stemming from the conceptual breakthrough of various metamaterials are reviewed; this burgeoning interdisciplinary field is coined as “flexible metamaterial electronics.” The artificial creation of metamaterials is able to break the current fetters and open a new direction for the further development of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Over the last decade, extensive efforts have been made on utilizing advanced materials and structures to improve the properties and functionalities of flexible electronics. While the conventional ways are approaching their natural limits, a revolutionary strategy, namely metamaterials, is emerging toward engineering structural materials to break the existing fetters. Metamaterials exhibit supernatural physical behaviors, in aspects of mechanical, optical, thermal, acoustic, and electronic properties that are inaccessible in natural materials, such as tunable stiffness or Poisson's ratio, manipulating electromagnetic or elastic waves, and topological and programmable morphability. These salient merits motivate metamaterials as a brand‐new research direction and have inspired extensive innovative applications in flexible electronics. Here, such a groundbreaking interdisciplinary field is first coined as “flexible metamaterial electronics,” focusing on enhancing and innovating functionalities of flexible electronics via the design of metamaterials. Herein, the latest progress and trends in this infant field are reviewed while highlighting their potential value. First, a brief overview starts with introducing the combination of metamaterials and flexible electronics. Then, the developed applications are discussed, such as self‐adaptive deformability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and multidisciplinary functionality, followed by the discussion of potential prospects. Finally, the challenges and opportunities facing flexible metamaterial electronics to advance this cutting‐edge field are summarized.

Recent progress in preparation techniques, materials design, interface modification, strategy for improving energy density, and multiple functionalities of TFBs is comprehensively summarized and discussed, and an overview of challenges and future perspectives is provided.








Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All‐solid‐state thin‐film lithium/lithium‐ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid‐state battery architecture and thin‐film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on‐chip power sources for IoT‐enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium‐ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet‐connected devices for the IoT are discussed. Recent progress in thin‐film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state‐of‐the‐art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next‐generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy‐harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices.

Being enabling technologies, here, the fabrication and integration techniques of small‐scale soft robots are systematically reviewed. By discussing the challenges and opportunities, potential directions for the further development of small‐scale soft robots are highlighted.








Abstract
Small‐scale soft robots are attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real‐time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating, and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. Here, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small‐scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing, and swelling, small‐scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism, and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability, and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetics, and other interdisciplinary sciences.

      <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large‐scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit‐level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high‐quality, wafer‐scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large‐scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

      <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/Nanoprocessing in Industrial Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The development trends, and advantages and deficiencies of three processing methods: micro/nanomolding, high‐energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining (microcutting, micro/nanowelding, and LIGA) are systematically summarized, adding to the existing body of knowledge for employing appropriate polymer processing techniques in customized industrial applications.








Abstract
Polymers are widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy‐harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nanoprocessing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high‐resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high‐resolution micro/nanostructures is explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small‐batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nanoprocessing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, the current state‐of‐the‐art techniques and future trends for micro/nanomolding, high‐energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining are discussed. Moreover, an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer‐based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors is provided. These techniques are expected to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next‐generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart, and biodegradable devices.

      <title>Building Practical High‐Voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium‐Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of lithium‐ion batteries is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. The key links in the development of the high‐voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization are considered and an overview of the challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high‐voltage cathode is presented.








Abstract
It has long been a global imperative to develop high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the ever‐growing electric vehicle market. One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of LIBs is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. As the most‐promising cathodes for high‐voltage LIBs (&gt;4 V vs Li/Li+), four major categories of cathodes including lithium‐rich layered oxides, nickel‐rich layered oxides, spinel oxides, and high‐voltage polyanionic compounds still encounter severe challenges to realize the improvement of output voltage while maintaining high capacity, fast rate capability, and long service life. This review focuses on the key links in the development of high‐voltage cathode materials from the lab to industrialization. First, the failure mechanisms of the four kinds of materials are clarified, and the optimization strategies, particularly solutions that are easy for large‐scale production, are considered. Then, to bridge the gap between lab and industry, the cost management, safety assessment, practical battery‐performance evaluation, and sustainability of the battery technologies, are discussed. Finally, tough challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high‐voltage cathode materials are summarized to promote the large‐scale application of LIBs with high energy densities.

Conductive metal–organic frameworks (c‐MOFs), as an emerging class of electrode materials, have attracted great attention recently. The efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of c‐MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are reviewed. The recent achievements of developing supercapacitors with c‐MOF electrodes are discussed, from the experimental performance to a fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanism, highlighting their bottlenecks and perspectives.








Abstract
As a class of porous materials with crystal lattices, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring outstanding specific surface area, tunable functionality, and versatile structures, have attracted huge attention in the past two decades. Since the first conductive MOF is successfully synthesized in 2009, considerable progress has been achieved for the development of conductive MOFs, allowing their use in diverse applications for electrochemical energy storage. Among those applications, supercapacitors have received great interest because of their high power density, fast charging ability, and excellent cycling stability. Here, the efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of conductive MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are summarized. Using conductive MOFs as a unique platform medium, the electronic and molecular aspects of the energy storage mechanism in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes are discussed, highlighting the advantages and limitations to inspire new ideas for the development of conductive MOFs for supercapacitors.

      <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide‐temperature structural‐material construction, low‐temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide‐temperature structural‐material construction, low‐temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

      <title>Intelligent Micro‐/Nanorobots for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on the recent advances of micro‐/nanorobots‐based cancer theragnostic is presented, ranging from actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery, as well as highlighting the most promising research opportunities for the next decade that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro‐/nanorobot (MNR)‐assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR‐based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles, which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re &lt;&lt; 1) environment by effective self‐propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next‐generation cancer‐therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging‐guided operation, and biosensing are additionally studied to enable the promising cancer‐related applications of MNRs. Herein, the recent advances in MNR‐based cancer therapy are comprehensively addresses, including actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; promising research opportunities that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade is highlighted.
