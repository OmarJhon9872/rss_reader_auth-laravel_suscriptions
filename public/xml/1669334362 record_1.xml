      <title>Protein metalation in a nutshell</title>
      <dc:description>
Metalation of proteins is logical within defined intracellular metal availabilities. Mis‐metalation is avoided because weaker binding metals are more available than tighter binding ones.







Metalation, the acquisition of metals by proteins, must avoid mis‐metalation with tighter binding metals. This is illustrated by four selected proteins that require different metals: all show similar ranked orders of affinity for bioavailable metals, as described in a universal affinity series (the Irving–Williams series). Crucially, cellular protein metalation occurs in competition with other metal binding sites. The strength of this competition defines the intracellular availability of each metal: its magnitude has been estimated by calibrating a cells' set of DNA‐binding, metal‐sensing, transcriptional regulators. This has established that metal availabilities (as free energies for forming metal complexes) are maintained to the inverse of the universal series. The tightest binding metals are least available. With these availabilities, correct metalation is achieved.

      <title>Artificial intelligence‐driven consensus gene signatures for improving bladder cancer clinical outcomes identified by multi‐center integration analysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on multiple bioinformatics and machine‐learning algorithms, we developed a robust and powerful consensus artificial intelligence gene signature (AIGS) that can accurately predict the prognosis, recurrence, and immune response for bladder cancer. In addition, AIGS is also a promising biomarker for predicting chemotherapy response, and the identification of potential compounds demonstrates dramatic implications of precise treatment for high‐risk patients.







To accurately predict the prognosis and further improve the clinical outcomes of bladder cancer (BLCA), we leveraged large‐scale data to develop and validate a robust signature consisting of small gene sets. Ten machine‐learning algorithms were enrolled and subsequently transformed into 76 combinations, which were further performed on eight independent cohorts (n = 1218). We ultimately determined a consensus artificial intelligence‐derived gene signature (AIGS) with the best performance among 76 model types. In this model, patients with high AIGS showed a higher risk of mortality, recurrence, and disease progression. AIGS is not only independent of traditional clinical traits [(e.g., American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage)] and molecular features (e.g., TP53 mutation) but also demonstrated superior performance to these variables. Comparisons with 58 published signatures also indicated that AIGS possessed the best performance. Additionally, the combination of AIGS and AJCC stage could achieve better performance. Patients with low AIGS scores were sensitive to immunotherapy, whereas patients with high AIGS scores might benefit from seven potential therapeutics: BRD‐K45681478, 1S,3R‐RSL‐3, RITA, U‐0126, temsirolimus, MRS‐1220, and LY2784544. Additionally, some mutations (TP53 and RB1), copy number variations (7p11.2), and a methylation‐driven target were characterized by AIGS‐related multi‐omics alterations. Overall, AIGS provides an attractive platform to optimize decision‐making and surveillance protocol for individual BLCA patients.

      <title>Optimal control of TABS using a combined method of MPC and heat load prediction</title>
      <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a control method combining MPC and heat load prediction using a neural network, a type of supervised learning in machine learning, for an office space with TABS. The method was validated by co‐simulation using CFD and MATLAB/Simulink on a one‐span (7.20 m  ×  7.20 m  ×  3.87 m) TABS model. As a result, the proposed method reduced the integrated water flow rate and improved the energy performance while improving the control performance.







Abstract
Thermally activated building systems (TABS), which use the building frame as a radiative and thermal storage site, have attracted attention as a means of achieving a thermal environment in office spaces that combines comfort and energy conservation. However, TABS have a large thermal capacity and a slow thermal response, making it desirable to introduce a control method based on model predictive control (MPC). There are problems with this method, such as its inability to predict periodic fluctuations in thermal load. Therefore, in this study, we propose a control method combining MPC and heat load prediction using a Neural Network, a type of supervised learning in machine learning, for an office space with TABS. The method was validated by co‐simulation using CFD and MATLAB/Simulink on a one‐span (7.20 × 7.20 × 3.87 m) TABS model. As a result, the proposed method reduced the integrated water flow rate and improved the energy performance while improving the control performance.

      <title>Semi‐supervised classification of fundus images combined with CNN and GCN</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes, which is a kind of fundus lesion with specific changes. Early diagnosis of DR can effectively reduce the visual damage caused by DR. Due to the variety and different morphology of DR lesions, automatic classification of fundus images in mass screening can greatly save clinicians' diagnosis time. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel framework—graph attentional convolutional neural network (GACNN).


Methods and Materials
The network consists of convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN). The global and spatial features of fundus images are extracted by using CNN and GCN, and attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the adaptability of GCN to topology map. We adopt semi‐supervised method for classification, which greatly improves the generalization ability of the network.


Results
In order to verify the effectiveness of the network, we conducted comparative experiments and ablation experiments. We use confusion matrix, precision, recall, kappa score, and accuracy as evaluation indexes. With the increase of the labeling rates, the classification accuracy is higher. Particularly, when the labeling rate is set to 100%, the classification accuracy of GACNN reaches 93.35%. Compared with DenseNet121, the accuracy rate is improved by 6.24%.


Conclusions
Semi‐supervised classification based on attention mechanism can effectively improve the classification performance of the model, and attain preferable results in classification indexes such as accuracy and recall. GACNN provides a feasible classification scheme for fundus images, which effectively reduces the screening human resources.

      <title>Evaluation of the clinical impact of the differences between planned and delivered dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy based on CT‐on‐rails IGRT and patient‐reported outcome scores</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
To estimate the clinical impact of differences between delivered and planned dose using dose metrics and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modeling.


Methods
Forty‐six consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2010 and 2015 treated with intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and who had undergone computed tomography on rails imaging were included. Delivered doses to bladder and rectum were estimated using a contour‐based deformable image registration method. The bladder and rectum NTCP were calculated using dose–response parameters applied to planned and delivered dose distributions. Seven urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms were prospectively collected using the validated prostate cancer symptom indices patient reported outcome (PRO) at pre‐treatment, weekly treatment, and post‐treatment follow‐up visits. Correlations between planned and delivered doses against PRO were evaluated in this study.


Results
Planned mean doses to bladder and rectum were 44.9 ± 13.6 Gy and 42.8 ± 7.3 Gy, while delivered doses were 46.1 ± 13.4 Gy and 41.3 ± 8.7 Gy, respectively. D10cc for rectum was 64.1 ± 7.6 Gy for planned and 60.1 ± 9.3 Gy for delivered doses. NTCP values of treatment plan were 22.3% ± 8.4% and 12.6% ± 5.9%, while those for delivered doses were 23.2% ± 8.4% and 9.9% ± 8.3% for bladder and rectum, respectively. Seven of 25 patients with follow‐up data showed urinary complications (28%) and three had rectal complications (12%). Correlations of NTCP values of planned and delivered doses with PRO follow‐up data were random for bladder and moderate for rectum (0.68 and 0.67, respectively).


Conclusion
Sensitivity of bladder to clinical variations of dose accumulation indicates that an automated solution based on a DIR that considers inter‐fractional organ deformation could recommend intervention. This is intended to achieve additional rectum sparing in cases that indicate higher than expected dose accumulation early during patient treatment in order to prevent acute severity of bowel symptoms.

      <title>Feasibility of radical cardiac‐sparing, treatment planning strategies for patients with locally advanced, non‐small cell lung cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
A set of treatment planning strategies were designed and retrospectively implemented for locally advanced, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in order to minimize cardiac dose without compromising target coverage goals.


Methods
Retrospective analysis was performed for 20 NSCLC patients prescribed to 60–66 Gy that received a mean heart dose (MHD) ≥10 Gy. Three planning approaches were designed and implemented. The first was a multi‐isocentric (MI) volume‐modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach (HEART_MI) with one isocenter located within the tumor and the second chosen up to 10 cm away longitudinally. The second was a noncoplanar (NCP) VMAT approach (HEART_NCP) utilizing up to three large couch angles and a standard arc at couch 0. The final planning strategy took a mixed approach (HEART_HYBRID) utilizing the HEART_NCP strategy for two thirds of the treatment combined with a plan utilizing a pair of opposite‐opposed gantry angles for the remaining treatments. Investigational plans were compared to original plans using dose–volume histogram metrics such as organ volume receiving greater than x Gy (Vx) or mean dose (Dmean).


Results
Although there was a small but statistically significant decrease in internal target volume coverage for HEART_MI plans and, conversely, a statistically significant increase for HEART_NCP plans, all generated plans met physician‐prescribed target constraints. For heart dose, there were statistically significant decreases in all heart metrics and particularly MHD for the HEART_MI (9.8 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001], respectively), HEART_NCP (9.2 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001]), respectively), and HEART_HYBRID (7.9 vs. 15.4 Gy [p &lt; 0.001], respectively) strategies.


Conclusions
The strategy providing the best compromise between plan quality and cardiac dose reduction was HEART_NCP, which produced MHD reductions of 37.6% ± 12.9% (6.2 ± 3.4 Gy) relative to original plans. This strategy could potentially reduce adverse cardiac events, leading to improved quality of life for these patients.

      <dc:description>
Abstract
Positron emission tomography with x‐ray computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly being utilized for radiation treatment planning (RTP). Accurate delivery of RT therefore depends on quality PET/CT data. This study covers quality control (QC) procedures required for PET/CT for diagnostic imaging and incremental QC required for RTP. Based on a review of the literature, it compiles a list of recommended tests, performance frequencies, and tolerances, as well as references to documents detailing how to perform each test. The report was commissioned by the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists as part of the Canadian Partnership for Quality Radiotherapy initiative.

Abstract
This section focuses on the professional workforce comprised of the primary medical specialties that utilize ionizing radiation in their practices. Those discussed include the specialties of radiology and radiation oncology, as well as the subspecialties of radiology, namely diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology, nuclear radiology, and nuclear medicine. These professionals provide essential health care services, for example, the interpretation of imaging studies, the provision of interventional procedures, radionuclide therapeutic treatments, and radiation therapy. In addition, they may be called on to function as part of a radiologic emergency response team to care for potentially exposed persons following radiation events, for example, detonation of a nuclear weapon, nuclear power plant accidents, and transportation incidents. For these reasons, maintenance of an adequate workforce in each of these professions is essential to meeting the nation's future needs. Currently, there is a shortage for all physicians in the medical radiology workforce.

      <title>A component method to delineate surgical spine implants for proton Monte Carlo dose calculation</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
Metallic implants have been correlated to local control failure for spinal sarcoma and chordoma patients due to the uncertainty of implant delineation from computed tomography (CT). Such uncertainty can compromise the proton Monte Carlo dose calculation (MCDC) accuracy. A component method is proposed to determine the dimension and volume of the implants from CT images.


Methods
The proposed component method leverages the knowledge of surgical implants from medical supply vendors to predefine accurate contours for each implant component, including tulips, screw bodies, lockers, and rods. A retrospective patient study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The reference implant materials and samples were collected from patient medical records and vendors, Medtronic and NuVasive. Additional CT images with extensive features, such as extended Hounsfield units and various reconstruction diameters, were used to quantify the uncertainty of implant contours.


Results
For in vivo patient implant estimation, the reference and the component method differences were 0.35, 0.17, and 0.04 cm3 for tulips, screw bodies, and rods, respectively. The discrepancies by a conventional threshold method were 5.46, 0.76, and 0.05 cm3, respectively. The mischaracterization of implant materials and dimensions can underdose the clinical target volume coverage by 20 cm3 for a patient with eight lumbar implants. The tulip dominates the dosimetry uncertainty as it can be made from titanium or cobalt–chromium alloys by different vendors.


Conclusions
A component method was developed and demonstrated using phantom and patient studies with implants. The proposed method provides more accurate implant characterization for proton MCDC and can potentially enhance the treatment quality for proton therapy. The current proof‐of‐concept study is limited to the implant characterization for lumbar spine. Future investigations could be extended to cervical spine and dental implants for head‐and‐neck patients where tight margins are required to spare organs at risk.

      <title>Automated field‐in‐field whole brain radiotherapy planning</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract

Purpose
We developed and tested an automatic field‐in‐field (FIF) solution for whole‐brain radiotherapy (WBRT) planning that creates a homogeneous dose distribution by minimizing hotspots, resulting in clinically acceptable plans.


Methods
A configurable auto‐planning algorithm was developed to automatically generate FIF WBRT plans independent of the treatment planning system. Configurable parameters include the definition of hotspots, target volume, maximum number of subfields, and minimum number of monitor units per field. This algorithm iteratively identifies a hotspot, creates two opposing subfields, calculates the dose, and optimizes the beam weight based on user‐configured constraints of dose‐volume histogram coverage and least‐squared cost functions. The algorithm was retrospectively tested on 17 whole‐brain patients. First, an in‐house landmark‐based automated beam aperture technique was used to generate the treatment fields and initial plans. Second, the FIF algorithm was employed to optimize the plans using physician‐defined goals of 99.9% of the brain volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and a target hotspot definition of 107% of the prescription dose. The final auto‐optimized plans were assessed for clinical acceptability by an experienced radiation oncologist using a five‐point scale.


Results
The FIF algorithm reduced the mean (± SD) plan hotspot percentage dose from 35.0 Gy (116.6%) ± 0.6 Gy (2.0%) to 32.6 Gy (108.8%) ± 0.4 Gy (1.2%). Also, it decreased the mean (± SD) hotspot V107% [cm3] from 959 ± 498 cm3 to 145 ± 224 cm3. On average, plans were produced in 16 min without any user intervention. Furthermore, 76.5% of the auto‐plans were clinically acceptable (needing no or minor stylistic edits), and all of them were clinically acceptable after minor clinically necessary edits.


Conclusions
This algorithm successfully produced high‐quality WBRT plans and can improve treatment planning efficiency when incorporated into an automatic planning workflow.

      <title>Customizable landmark‐based field aperture design for automated whole‐brain radiotherapy treatment planning</title>
      <dc:description>

Purpose
To develop and evaluate an automated whole‐brain radiotherapy (WBRT) treatment planning pipeline with a deep learning–based auto‐contouring and customizable landmark‐based field aperture design.


Methods
The pipeline consisted of the following steps: (1) Auto‐contour normal structures on computed tomography scans and digitally reconstructed radiographs using deep learning techniques, (2) locate the landmark structures using the beam's‐eye‐view, (3) generate field apertures based on eight different landmark rules addressing different clinical purposes and physician preferences. Two parallel approaches for generating field apertures were developed for quality control. The performance of the generated field shapes and dose distributions were compared with the original clinical plans. The clinical acceptability of the plans was assessed by five radiation oncologists from four hospitals.


Results
The performance of the generated field apertures was evaluated by the Hausdorff distance (HD) and mean surface distance (MSD) from 182 patients’ field apertures used in the clinic. The average HD and MSD for the generated field apertures were 16 ± 7 and 7 ± 3 mm for the first approach, respectively, and 17 ± 7 and 7 ± 3 mm, respectively, for the second approach. The differences regarding HD and MSD between the first and the second approaches were 1 ± 2 and 1 ± 3 mm, respectively. A clinical review of the field aperture design, conducted using 30 patients, achieved a 100% acceptance rate for both the first and second approaches, and the plan review achieved a 100% acceptance rate for the first approach and a 93% acceptance rate for the second approach. The average acceptance rate for meeting lens dosimetric recommendations was 80% (left lens) and 77% (right lens) for the first approach, and 70% (both left and right lenses) for the second approach, compared with 50% (left lens) and 53% (right lens) for the clinical plans.


Conclusion
This study provided an automated pipeline with two field aperture generation approaches to automatically generate WBRT treatment plans. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated that our novel pipeline was comparable with the original clinical plans.

      <title>Predicting chronic opioid use among patients with osteoarthritis using electronic health record data</title>
      <dc:description>

Objective
To estimate the risk, using electronic health record (EHR) data and predictive models, of a patient with osteoarthritis (OA) developing chronic opioid use (COU) within 1 year of a new opioid prescription.


Methods
We used EHR data from 13 healthcare organizations to identify OA patients with an opioid prescription between 03/01/2017 and 02/28/2019 and no record of opioid use in the prior 6 months. We evaluated 4 machine learning models to estimate patients’ risk of COU (≥3 prescriptions over ≥84 days, maximum gap ≤60 days). We also estimated the transportability of models to organizations outside the training set.


Results
The cohort consisted of 33,894 patients with OA, of whom 2,925 (8.6%) developed COU within 1 year. All models demonstrated good discrimination, with the best‐performing model (random forest) achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.728 (95% CI, 0.711–0.745), but the simplest regression model performed nearly as well (AUC of 0.717; 95% CI, 0.699–0.734). Predicted risk deciles spanned a range of 2% risk for the 10th percentile to 18% risk for the 90th percentile for well‐calibrated models. Models showed highly variable discrimination across organizations (AUC 0.571–0.842).


Conclusions
We found that EHR‐based predictive models could estimate the risk of future COU among OA patients to help inform care decisions. Black‐box methods did not have significant advantages over more interpretable models. Care should be taken when extending all models into organizations not included in model training due to high variability in performance across held‐out organizations.

      <title>Prediction Models to Estimate The Future Risk of Osteoarthritis in the General Population: A Systematic Review</title>
      <dc:description>

Objective
To evaluate the performance and applicability of multivariable prediction models for osteoarthritis (OA).


Methods
Systematic review and narrative synthesis using three databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science; inception to December 2021). We included general population longitudinal studies reporting derivation, comparison, or validation of multivariable models to predict individual risk of OA incidence, defined by recognised clinical or imaging criteria. We excluded studies reporting prevalent OA and joint arthroplasty outcome. Paired reviewers independently performed article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Model performance, calibration and retained predictors were summarised.


Results
26 studies were included reporting 31 final multivariable prediction models for incident knee (23), hip (4), hand (3) and any‐site OA (1), with a median of outcome events of 121.5 (range: 27‐12,803), median prediction horizon of 8 years (2‐41), and a median of 6 predictors (3‐24). Age, body mass index, previous injury, and occupational exposures were among the most commonly included predictors. Model discrimination after validation was generally acceptable to excellent (Area Under the Curve = 0.70 to 0.85). Either internal or external validation processes were used in most models although risk of bias was often judged to be high with limited applicability to mass application in diverse populations.


Conclusion
Despite growing interest in multivariable prediction models for incident OA, there remains a predominant focus on the knee, reliance on data from a small pool of appropriate cohort datasets, and concerns over general population applicability.

      <title>Female gender and age are associated to unfavorable response to TNFα inhibitors in patients with axial Spondyloarthritis: results of statistical and artificial intelligence‐based data analyses of a national multicentric prospective registry</title>
      <dc:description>

Background
Real‐world studies are needed to identify factors associated to response to biological therapies in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).


Objective
To assess gender differences in response to tumor necrosis factor‐α inhibitors (TNFi) and to explore possible risk factors associated with TNFi efficacy.


Patients and methods
A total of 969 patients with axSpA (315 females, 654 males), enrolled in the BIOBADASER registry (2000‐2019) who initiated a TNFi (first, second or further lines) were studied. Statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)‐based data analyses were used to explore the association of gender differences, and other factors, to TNFi response (BASDAI50 and ASDAS‐CRP).


Results
Females had a lower probability of reaching a BASDAI50 response with a first line TNFi treatment at the second year of follow‐up (p=0.018) and a lesser reduction of the ASDAS‐CRP scores at this time‐point. The logistic regression model showed lower BASDAI50 responses to TNFi in females (p=0.05). Other factors, such as older age (p=0.004) were associated with unfavorable responses. The AI data analyses reinforced that age at the beginning of the treatment was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response. Its combination with other clinical characteristics (female sex or cardiovascular risk factors and events) potentially contributed to an unfavorable response to TNFi.


Conclusions
In this national multicentric registry, female gender was associated with less response to a first line TNFi by the second year of follow‐up. A higher age at the start of the TNFi was the main factor associated to unfavorable response to TNFi.

      <title>Neuro‐fuzzy Elman wavelet control for nonlinear uncertain systems with fuzzy input and unknown fuzzy disturbances: Application to robotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
Keeping into view the irregular existence of uncertainties and disturbances in nonlinear systems, a novel adaptive control scheme based on neuro‐fuzzy Elman wavelet neural network (NFEWNN) has been proposed in this work which is capable of accurately modeling system uncertainties. In addition to this, an improvement in an evolutionary algorithm named particle swarm optimization has also been introduced to optimize the initial parameters of the controller. Uncertain non‐linear discrete‐time systems in the non‐strict feedback form with unknown disturbances are taken into consideration. This work aims to design an efficient adaptive control scheme for the proposed systems in the case of fuzzy input and fuzzy external disturbance which makes the control of the system more complex and difficult. The proposed NFEWNN control scheme is capable of tracking the desired trajectory successfully along with accurately modeling system uncertainties with high computational power, low computational burden, and rapid convergence rate. The stability of the controller has been proved using Lyapunov theory and guaranteed convergence of the controller is proved. Finally, real‐world applications of the work have been found in robotics. The controller has been implemented on the robotic manipulator and the dynamic model of aerial robotic vehicles to prove its effectiveness and efficiency.

      <title>Adaptive optimal tracking control with novel event‐triggered formulation for a type of nonlinear systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
In this article, an event‐based intelligent critic algorithm is developed to address the optimal tracking control problem for a type of discrete‐time nonlinear systems. The nonlinear optimal tracking control design is replaced by solving the optimal regulation problem of the error system. Then, the generalized value iteration algorithm is employed to obtain the admissible tracking control law with off‐line learning. Next, a novel triggering condition is designed to reduce the update times of the controller and improve the resource utilization. It is emphasized that this triggering condition is established based on the iteration of the time‐triggered mechanism. Moreover, in order to realize the cost guarantee of the error system, the real cost function is proved to possess a predetermined upper bound. By analysis, it is shown that the error system is asymptotically stable while the tracking error and the sampling signal are uniformly ultimately bounded during the process of training neural networks. Finally, two examples are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

      <title>IoT enabled lung cancer detection and routing algorithm using CBSOA‐based ShCNN</title>
      <dc:description>
Summary
The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously spread worldwide, and it influenced the world through easy connectivity, interoperability, and interconnectivity using IoT devices. Numerous techniques have been developed using IoT‐enabled health care systems for cancer detection, but some limitations exist in transmitting the health data to the cloud. The limitations can be accomplished using the proposed chronological‐based social optimization algorithm (CBSOA) that effectively transmits the patient's health data using IoT network, thereby detecting lung cancer in an effective way. Initially, nodes in the IoT network are simulated such that patient's health data are collected, and for transmission of such data, routing is performed in order to transmit the health data from source to destination through a gateway based on cloud service using CBSOA. The fitness is newly modeled by assuming the factors like energy, distance, trust, delay, and link quality. Finally, lung cancer detection is carried out at the destination point. At the destination point, the acquired input data is fed to preprocessing phase to make the data acceptable for further mechanism using data normalization. Once the feature selection is done using Canberra distance, then the lung cancer detection is performed using shepard convolutional neural network (ShCNN). The process of routing as well as training of ShCNN is performed using the CBSOA algorithm, which is devised by the inclusion of the chronological concept into the social optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.940, maximum sensitivity of 0.941, maximum specificity of 0.928, and minimum energy of 0.452.

      <title>Multiscale Biofabrication: Integrating Additive Manufacturing with DNA‐Programmable Self‐Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of additive manufacturing techniques with bottom‐up self‐assembly allows the fabrication of macroscopic synthetic biological objects with a structure defined at the sub‐micrometer level. This review gives an overview of advances in this direction, with a particular focus on the use of DNA self‐assembly and self‐organization in this context.








Abstract
Structure and hierarchical organization are crucial elements of biological systems and are likely required when engineering synthetic biomaterials with life‐like behavior. In this context, additive manufacturing techniques like bioprinting have become increasingly popular. However, 3D bioprinting, as well as other additive manufacturing techniques, show limited resolution, making it difficult to yield structures on the sub‐cellular level. To be able to form macroscopic synthetic biological objects with structuring on this level, manufacturing techniques have to be used in conjunction with biomolecular nanotechnology. Here, a short overview of both topics and a survey of recent advances to combine additive manufacturing with microfabrication techniques and bottom‐up self‐assembly involving DNA, are given.

Here, a short overview of both topics and a survey of recent advances to combine additive manufacturing with microfabrication techniques and bottom‐up self‐assembly involving DNA, are given.

The experimental results show that the error of the proposed algorithm is significantly less than that of the traditional control algorithm.

Abstract
The development of intelligent technology has led to the more frequent use of robots in industrial production, but the control problems in the redundant robotic arms of industrial robots have hindered their normal development. Therefore, in the study, in order to achieve automatic control of the redundant robotic arm of industrial robots, a multi‐objective redundant robotic arm automatic control algorithm based on improved generalized weighted least squares and multi‐objective feedback teaching and learning optimization algorithm is proposed. In the results, it is shown that the multi‐objective optimization algorithm is effective for the control of the redundant robotic arm, and from the rectification results it is shown that the speed and position errors are only manifested at 0.005 s after time and there is no difference between its speed and position values. The above results show that for the automatic control of redundant robotic arms of industrial robots, the use of multi‐objective optimization control is effective and can provide theoretical support for industrial production and industrial development, thus promoting the development of China's market economy.

      <title>Four‐dimensional printing of shape memory polymers, blends and composites and their advanced applications: A comprehensive literature review</title>
      <dc:description>
4D printing is defined as the additive manufacturing process of smart (stimuli‐responsive) materials. Shape memory materials are sensitive to specific stimuli such as heat, electricity, magnetic fields, etc., which can change their form or properties. This characteristic gives the material a dynamic behavior over time (the 4th dimension). The application of the 4D printing technique is currently being explored in various fields, including soft robotics, electrical devices, deployable structures, medical implants, and medicine delivery systems. This paper first examines the fundamentals of 3D printing techniques, their advantages and limitations. Then, the shape memory materials are categorized and reviewed according to their type (shape memory polymers, shape memory composites, polymer blends, etc.) and stimulus responsiveness. Lastly, different properties of shape memory materials like shape memory effect, thermo‐mechanical properties, and their compatibility with different types of additive manufacturing processes, are discussed.

      <title>Chemiresistive Sensor Arrays for Gas/VOC Monitoring: A review</title>
      <dc:description>
Gas detection and monitoring are essential due to their direct impact on human health, environment, and ecosystem. Chemiresistive sensors are one of the most used classes of sensors for monitoring and measurement of gases thanks to their ease of fabrication, customizability, mechanical flexibility, and fast response time. While chemiresistive sensors can offer good sensitivity and selectivity to a particular gas in a controlled environment with known interferences, they may not be able to differentiate between various gases having similar physiochemical properties under uncontrolled conditions. To address this short coming of chemiresistive gas sensors, sensor arrays have been the subject of recent studies. Gas sensor arrays are a group of individual gas sensors that are arranged to simultaneously detect and differentiate multiple cross‐reactive gases. In this regard various sensor array technologies have been developed to differentiate a given set of gases using multi‐variate algorithms. This review provides an insight into the different algorithms that are used to extract the data from the sensor arrays, highlighting the fabrication techniques used for developing the sensor array prototypes, and different applications in which these arrays are used.

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of High‐Entropy CrMoNbTaVW Thin Films Using High‐Throughput Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, a time‐efficient investigation of complex‐concentration CrMoNbTaVW alloys is presented. High‐throughput synthesis and automated characterization and analysis techniques provide a large dataset that can be used to create data libraries for complex material systems.


High‐entropy alloys (HEAs) or complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) offer a huge research area for new material compositions and potential applications. Since the combination of several elements sometimes leads to unexpected and unpredictable material properties. In addition to the element combinations, the optimization of the element proportions in CCAs and HEAs is also a decisive factor in tailoring desired material properties. However, it is almost impossible to achieve the composition and characterization of CCAs and HEAs with a sufficient number of compositions by conventional experiments. Therefore, an optimized high‐throughput magnetron sputtering synthesis to fabricate a new HEA gradient layer of six elements is presented. With this approach, the compositional space of the HEA system CrMoNbTaVW can be studied in different subsections to determine the influence of the individual elements and their combinations on the structure, morphology, and physical properties (hardness and resistivity). It is found that the Cr‐, Ta‐, and W‐rich phases, which have a grain size of 10–11 nm, exhibit the hardest mechanical properties, whereas V‐, Ta‐, and Cr‐rich compounds exhibit the highest electrical resistivity. The combination of high‐throughput synthesis, automated analysis tools, and automated data interpretation enables rapid and time‐efficient characterization of the novel CrMoNbTaVW gradient film.

      <title>A Perspective on Methods to Computationally Design the Morphology of Aerogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, the author aims at elucidating the diverse methodologies and modeling approaches applied to design or construct the open‐porous morphology of aerogels. Insights into the pros and cons of these techniques and an outlook toward improving or extending these models and the application of machine learning approaches are provided.


Reconstructing aerogel morphology presents significant challenges, in particular, if 3D visualizations of their mesoporous network are desired. Available microscopic and tomographic tools find it difficult to probe into all types of aerogels for the purposes of reconstructing their 3D nanoporous morphology. This is where computational approaches have shown promising efforts. Herein, diverse models that can be applied to describing different aerogels are explored. To begin with, cluster–cluster aggregation models are examined for simulating the sol–gel process and the resulting morphologies in fractal aerogels, e.g., silica‐based. Gaussian random field models and polymerization‐induced phase separation models are explored for modeling organic non‐fractal aerogels, e.g., resorcinol‐formaldehyde (RF) ones. This is followed by Langevin‐dynamics‐based discrete element models that are explored for simulating gelation in fibrillar aerogels, e.g., those from biopolymer sources. Lastly, modified Voronoi approaches are investigated for describing the 3D fibrillar morphology, also of fibrillar aerogels, like those from biopolymers. A perspective is presented highlighting the strengths as well as shortcomings in each of the model approaches. Possibilities to either extend available approaches or explore new ones are briefly discussed at every interval.

      <title>Adhesive Hybrid Interpenetrating Network Hydrogel‐Based Detector to Monitor Solar Radiation Dose Required for Plant Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on an excellent photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) in combination with low weight, a hybrid interpenetration polymer network hydrogel on polypropylene fabrics is designed into a solar radiation detector, which can be easily adhered onto plant leaves and monitor the solar radiation dose required for the growth of a plant like Epipremnum aureum by checking the discoloration under sunshine.


An adhesive and visualized hydrogel‐based detector is designed to monitor the solar radiation dose required for plant growth by the discoloration of methylene blue (MB) under sunshine. The detector is based on hybrid hydrogels prepared from photoinitiated polymerization. The combination of polypropylene (PP) fabrics acting as a substrate and the photoinitiated polymerization on the graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) surface enables a smaller thickness and a more homogenous distribution of the g‐C3N4 nanosheets. Thus, the hybrid interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel on the PP fabrics with a thickness of 1.5 mm presents an improved photodegradation capability. In addition, better mechanical properties and lower weight of the hydrogel‐based detector are achieved by the presence of the PP fabrics. In combination with the stickiness from a polyurethane resin acting as glue, the obtained detector can be easily pasted on the leaf of a plant as demonstrated for the example of Epipremnum aureum. The radiation dose exposed to the leaves can be accurately traced from the change in color of the detector to ensure a sufficient radiation for plant growth and avoid possible burn to the leaves under sunshine.

      <title>Electroactive Bistable Actuators with Tunable Snap‐through Performances and Adjustable Mechanical Bending Modes for Ultrafast Bioinspired Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Shape‐memory alloy (SMA) actuators typically exhibit limited response speed owing to the long duration required for the alloy to cool down and return to its natural shape and compliance after electrically‐thermal actuation. This paper proposes a generic design principle for harnessing the mechanical instability of the bistable mechanism to improve the response properties and output force of SMA actuators. The SMA actuator presented herein is constructed by combining spring‐based bistable linkages and SMA springs as a “skeletal spine” and “skeletal muscles,” respectively. Most existing SMA actuators are designed as inherently and unimodally stable, whereas the working performance of our design suggests that it rapidly stores and releases energy within tens of milliseconds by regulating the bistable mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a highly dynamic SMA actuator that can generate a force of ∽3.4 N, bend through 60o in 0.05 s, and achieve periodic deformation under the alternating actuation of two SMA springs. Furthermore, two representative demonstrations of dynamic impact excitation and jumping are verified. Owing to these properties, the actuator can pave a new path toward constructing next‐generation, high‐performance smart actuators with multiple scales and functionalities. It can be applied to next‐generation high‐performance robotic or actuation systems with multifunctional characteristics.

Furthermore, we demonstrate a highly dynamic SMA actuator that can generate a force of ∽3.4 N, bend through 60o in 0.05 s, and achieve periodic deformation under the alternating actuation of two SMA springs. Furthermore, two representative demonstrations of dynamic impact excitation and jumping are verified. Owing to these properties, the actuator can pave a new path toward constructing next‐generation, high‐performance smart actuators with multiple scales and functionalities. It can be applied to next‐generation high‐performance robotic or actuation systems with multifunctional characteristics.

      <title>Multiscale Optimization of 3D‐printed beam‐based lattice structures through elastically tailored unit cells</title>
      <dc:description>
In this paper a numerical multiscale tool is developed to design three‐dimensional periodic lattice structures. The work is motivated by the high design freedom of additive manufacturing technologies, which enable complex multiscale lattice structures to be printed. A finite element‐based free material optimization method is used to determine the ideal orthotropic material properties of a 3D macro‐structure space. Subsequently, a population‐based algorithm is established to design optimized microscopic lattice unit cells with the desired structural properties. The design variables are the coordinates of lattice skeleton nodes defined within the three‐dimensional lattice unit cell space, and the connectivities between them resulting a truss‐skeleton. For the calculation of the mechanical properties of the individual lattice cells, an effective Timoshenko beam‐based finite element calculation method was developed. The macroscale structure can be constructed by periodically filling the domain with the customized unit cell representing a metamaterial. The method is demonstrated by three dimensional beam problems with compliance constraints. These macroscopic demonstrators of the developed lattice structures were also 3D‐printed. The benefit regarding the weight‐specific structural performance is validated through benchmarking with periodic lattice design solutions using well‐known standard lattice cells.

      <title>Recent Advances in Laser‐Induced Graphene: Mechanism, Fabrication, Properties, and Applications in Flexible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Laser‐induced graphene (LIG) is an emerging porous material produced when irradiating a laser beam on certain carbon materials. This in‐depth review highlights the recent advances in LIG research, including the mechanism of LIG formation, typical lasers in LIG fabrication, effects of lasing parameters on LIG structures and properties, and applications of LIG in flexible electronics.








Abstract
Laser‐induced graphene (LIG) is a newly emerging 3D porous material produced when irradiating a laser beam on certain carbon materials. LIG exhibits high porosity, excellent electrical conductivity, and good mechanical flexibility. Predesigned LIG patterns can be directly fabricated on diverse carbon materials with controllable microstructure, surface property, electrical conductivity, chemical composition, and heteroatom doping. This selective, low‐cost, chemical‐free, and maskless patterning technology minimizes the usage of raw materials, diminishes the environmental impact, and enables a wide range of applications ranging from academia to industry. In this review, the recent developments in 3D porous LIG are comprehensively summarized. The mechanism of LIG formation is first introduced with a focus on laser‐material interactions and material transformations during laser irradiation. The effects of laser types, fabrication parameters, and lasing environment on LIG structures and properties are thoroughly discussed. The potentials of LIG for advanced applications including biosensors, physical sensors, supercapacitors, batteries, triboelectric nanogenerators, and so on are also highlighted. Finally, current challenges and future prospects of LIG research are discussed.

      <title>Lightweight Liquid Metal‐Elastomer Foam with Smart Multi‐Function</title>
      <dc:description>
An inside to outside strategy is proposed for one‐step fabrication of lightweight foam (density &lt;0.3 g cm−3) with bicontinuous structure of polymer and metal. A stable conductive network with ultra‐low liquid metal content is constructed and the formation mechanism is studied in detail. The bicontinuous structure endows the foam with excellent reversible and controllable rigidity, lightweight, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Lightweight metal‐polymer composited foam has drawn considerable attention in fields of wearable electronics, acoustic and electromagnetic shielding, automotive and aerospace manufacturing, owing to its unique advantages like electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Herein, a facile strategy is studied for one‐step fabrication of multifunctional liquid metal (LM) permeated expancel microspheres foam (EMLM foam) with controllable shape and size. Specifically, the formation process and mechanism of bicontinuous structure with polymer and liquid metal are explored by real‐time monitoring and finite element simulation. Both experimental and simulating results confirmed a stable 3D metal interconnected network that can be constructed with lower limit of LM (3 vol.%). In addition, based on the unique features of reversible rigidity control, lightweight, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability, the EMLM foam can exhibit intelligent performance in tunable acoustic, energy absorption, and thermal driving repair. Combined with EMLM foam's facile preparation process and versatility, it can provide the remarkable opportunity to develop the lightweight intelligent devices.

      <title>Volatile 2D Ruddlesden‐Popper Perovskite: A Gift for α‐Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
2D perovskites in situ generated from a series of bulky primary alkylammoniums are found to be volatile and are used to prepare phase‐ and compositionally‐pure α‐formamidinium lead triiodide solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells with increasingly pure composition of α‐formamidinium lead triiodide (α‐FAPbI3) perovskite are utilized to set more and more record‐breaking efficiencies. However, pure α‐FAPbI3 perovskite is unstable and difficult to prepare. Here, a series of bulky alkylammoniums known as the spacer cations (RP cations) of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (2D perovskites) are used to prepare α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films. The deprotonation process of RP cations during annealing removes the in situ generated 2D perovskites from the film, which determines the phase and compositional purity, crystallinity, and stability of α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films and depends on the design of RP cations. Only a small number of residual RP cations (0.3–2.3%) are found anchoring at grain boundaries. As a result, α‐FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells prepared from RP cations, especially 2‐thiophenemethylammonium, show higher efficiency and stability than control devices prepared from the most commonly used methylammonium. It is believed that in situ generated 2D perovskites are ideal additives for α‐FAPbI3 perovskite, because a large addition (20%) of 2D perovskites ensures the preparation of high‐quality phase‐pure α‐FAPbI3 perovskite films, while a small number of residual RP cations anchored at grain boundaries guarantee the performance and stability of α‐FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells.

      <title>Immunocyte‐Derived Nanodrugs for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the advancements of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs, including membrane‐coated nanoparticles, exosomes or extracellular vesicles, functional protein‐incorporated nanoparticles, and exosome mimetics, is presented, with an emphasis on their preparation, structure, properties, and latest applications in cancer therapy. The current limitations and future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of the biomimetic nanotechnology regarding the use of certain components (such as cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, proteins, etc.) derived from different cells to fabricate nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer treatment. These biomimetic NPs usually inherit certain abilities from their parental cells, such as long blood circulation, capacity to escape from mononuclear phagocytic system, active tumor‐targeting, and controlled drug release. Immunocytes play vital roles in different tumor progression stages, and can quickly and accurately react to tumor progression via specific targeting and immune surveillance. Therefore, increasing studies focus on constructing biomimetic NPs with components isolated from immunocytes. This review introduces four main types of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs—membrane‐coated NPs, exosomes or extracellular vesicles, functional protein‐incorporated NPs, and exosome mimetics—and summarizes the recent advances of these nanodrugs for cancer therapy. Some current challenges and future research directions of immunocyte‐derived nanodrugs are also proposed. It is hoped that this review may help researchers in the related field to design new immunocyte‐derived nanomedicines and promote their preclinical and clinical applications in the near future.

      <title>Resistance Drift Convergence and Inversion in Amorphous Phase Change Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Resistance drift of amorphous phase‐change materials (PCMs) is usually explained by structural relaxation. It manifests itself in aging, stabilization, and rejuvenation. It is found that these processes lead to resistance drift, convergence, and drift inversion. The resistance evolution is described accurately by conventional glass dynamics. These findings will help to realize drift‐free multi‐level PCM devices essential for brain‐inspired neuromorphic networks and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) are key to the development of artificial intelligence technologies such as high‐density memories and neuromorphic computing, thanks to their ability for multi‐level data storage through stepwise resistive encoding. Individual resistance levels are realized by adjusting the crystalline and amorphous volume fraction of the memory cell. However, the amorphous phase exhibits a drift in resistance over time that has so far hindered the commercial implementation of multi‐level storage schemes. In this study, the underlying physical process of resistance drift with the goal of modeling is elucidated that will help minimize and potentially overcome drift in PCM memory devices. Clear evidence is provided that the resistance drift is dominated by glass dynamics. Resistivity convergence and drift inversion for the amorphous chalcogenide Ge15Te85 and the PCM Ge3Sb6Te5 are experimentally demonstrated and these changes are successfully predicted with a glass dynamics model. This new insight into the resistance drift process provides tools for the development of advanced PCM devices.

The study finds multilevel ferroelectric domain wall diodes at the LiNbO3 interface and proposes three‐terminal ferroelectric DW transistors fabricated at the surface of the polarized LiNbO3 single crystal. These transistors can function as NOT, NAND, and NOR logic gates in addition to intrinsic nonvolatile data storage.








Abstract
Direct data processing in nonvolatile memories can enable area‐ and energy‐efficient computation, unlike independent performance between separate processing and memory units; repetitive data transfer between these units represents a fundamental performance limitation in modern computers. Spatially mobile conducting domain walls in ferroelectrics can be redirected between drain, gate, and source electrodes to function as nonvolatile transistors with superior energy efficiency, ultrafast operating and communication speeds, and high logic/storage densities. Here, in‐memory computing is demonstrated using multilevel domain wall diodes at LiNbO3 interfaces. Ultrathin domains within interfacial layers between each mesa‐like memory cell and the contact electrodes can rectify diode‐like domain wall currents with on/off current ratios exceeding 107 at low operating voltages, surpassing the performance of traditional p‐n junctions using built‐in potentials across depletion layers. NOT, NAND, and NOR gate logic functions are demonstrated, providing insights into high‐density integration of multilevel storage and computational units in all‐ferroelectric domain wall devices.

      <title>Subaqueous Bioprinting: A Novel Strategy for Fetal Membrane Repair with 7‐Axis Robot‐Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
      <dc:description>
The 7‐axis bioprinting robot combined with an ultrafast photo‐responsive hydrogel enables minimally invasive subaqueous in vivo bioprinting and construction of specifically designed hydrogel patch to seal premature rupture of membranes (PROM), providing a novel strategy for the treatment of PROM and other diseases involving tissue injury in clinical settings.








Abstract
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM), defined as breakage of the amniotic sac prior to delivery, complicates 2–4% of pregnancies, leads to one‐third of preterm births, and increases the risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity in survivors. In situ bioprinting enables the fabrication of 3D structures directly for tissue repair or reconstruction in living animals, but is challenging to perform in the subaqueous narrow space where fetal membranes are located. This study reports a novel strategy consisting of an ultrafast photoresponsive hydrogel (1.5 s) and a 7‐axis bioprinting robot to perform subaqueous in situ bioprinting in a minimally invasive approach. Specially, a hydrogel patch with designed gel rivets is printed subaqueously for the therapeutic needs of PROM, and the patch displays robust tissue adhesion, favorable biocompatibility, mechanical properties resembling native tissues, and an appropriate sealing timescale to prolong pregnancy. Experiments performed in an in vitro uterus model and a mid‐gestational rabbit model show a favorable sealing effect for PROM, which validates the potential of this subaqueous bioprinting approach for application. This study not only expands upon in situ bioprinting techniques, but also provides valuable insights for the treatment of PROM and other diseases involving tissue injury in clinical settings.

      <title>Understanding the Solution‐State Doping of Donor–Acceptor Polymers Through Tailored Side Chain Engineering for Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
The aggregation effects of donor–acceptor polymers on the molecular doping behavior are demonstrated by side chain engineering and comparison of doping methods for thermoelectric (TE) applications. According to aggregation behavior, Lewis complexes and doping compete, highly aggregated polymers restrict Lewis complex formation and facilitate doping, leading to high TE power factors of up to 23.7 µW m−1 K−2.








Abstract
Among the molecular doping methods widely utilized to control charge carriers in organic thermoelectric (TE) devices, solution mixing is attractive for the preparation of uniform and thick TE films to obtain high output powers. However, the effects of doping behavior in solution‐state polymers on their film properties are still not well understood, particularly for donor–acceptor (D‐A) polymers, key materials for high‐performance (opto)electronic devices. Here, by preparing three D‐A polymers with engineered side chains, the aggregation effects of D‐A polymers on the doping behavior in the solution and film states are demonstrated. In a less aggregated polymer, mixing the solution with a p‐dopant leads to the Lewis complex formation, which reduces doping efficiency and power factor. However, solution mixing of aggregated polymers induces the formation of ion pairs with the dopant, resulting in power factors that are two orders of magnitude higher at 23.7 µW m−1 K−2. Doping in the film state where aggregation is induced facilitates ion‐pair formation, resulting in smaller deviation in TE properties (power factors = 9.0–16.4 µW m−1 K−2) despite differences in their ordering structures. These results provide an in‐depth understanding of efficient solution‐state doping of D‐A polymers for TEs.

      <title>Cellulose‐Reinforced Programmable and Stretch‐Healable Actuators for Smart Packaging</title>
      <dc:description>
A humidity‐responsive actuator with good programmability for tunable actuation response, high mechanical strength to withstand rupture, and the ability to self‐healin for long‐term usage are designed and fabricated. The smart devices fabricated from this cellulose‐reinforced actuator demonstrate promising potential in smart sensing and packaging materials.








Abstract
Biomimetic actuators are promising candidates for smart soft robotics. The applications of state‐of‐the‐art actuators require the combination of programmable stimuli‐responsiveness, excellent robustness, and efficient self‐healing ability in a wide‐range of working conditions. However, these properties may be mutually exclusive. Inspired by biological tissues, two kinds of polyelectrolytes including polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) are exploited as the fillers of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) for the fabrication of the CNF/PVA/PSS (CAS) film via the assembly of the physically‐crosslinked network through multiple H‐bonding and electrostatic interactions. Achieved by a casting‐evaporation strategy, internal stress is stored within the polymer matrix and transforms into reversible anisotropic bending deformations in response to a humidity gradient. The speed, direction, and pitch of the bending can be programmed by tailoring the internal stresses and geometry of the samples. Moreover, the H‐bonded network also contributes to the effective energy dissipation toward high toughness during tensile stretching, as well as self‐healing ability during moisture saturation of the CAS films. This enables the fabrication of a humidity‐sensitive flower‐shaped actuator and self‐healable packaging paper. This study presents a biomimetic strategy for the fabrication of multi‐functional soft robotics, which holds great promise for applications in the fields of biosensors and smart packaging.

      <title>Multi‐Control of Ion Transport in a Field‐Effect Iontronic Device based on Sandwich‐Structured Nanochannels</title>
      <dc:description>
A field‐effect iontronic device based on ionomer/anodic aluminum oxide/conducting polymer sandwich‐structured nanochannel is constructed to realize the multi‐control of ion transport behaviors including ion conductance, ion current rectification (ICR magnitude, and ICR direction by modulating the surface charge, wettability, and morphology of the nanochannel. The tunable surface charge of electroactive conducting polymer and complex three‐segment structure contribute to the multi‐control of nanofluidic behaviors.








Abstract
Biomimetic smart nanochannels can regulate ion transport behavior responsive to the external stimuli, having huge potential in nanofluidic devices, sensors and energy conversion. Field‐effect nanofluidic diodes or transistors based on electric‐responsive nanochannels are emerging owing to their advantages such as non‐invasiveness, in situ, real time, and high efficiency. However, simultaneously realizing the voltage‐control of the ion conductance and ion current rectification (ICR) properties is still a big challenge. Here, a field‐effect iontronic device is developed based on ionomer/anodic aluminum oxide/conducting polymer sandwich‐structured nanochannel to realize the multi‐control of ion transport behaviors including ion conductance, ICR magnitude, and ICR direction by modulating the surface charge, wettability, and morphology of the nanochannel. The electroactive conducting polymer carries tunable surface charges responsive to the electric stimuli, leading to the regulation of ICR values. The complex three‐segment structures lead to the reverse of ICR direction by reconfiguring the charge distribution along with the whole channel. The switching wettability between hydrophilic and hydrophobic results in the regulation of ion conductance. Furthermore, the field‐effect iontronic device functions in a wide salinity range especially in hypersaline environment, due to the salinity‐adaptive properties of the membrane. A new route is provided for designing more functional field‐effect nanofluidic devices.

      <title>Deep‐Learning‐Assisted Noncontact Gesture‐Recognition System for Touchless Human‐Machine Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
An intelligent noncontact gesture‐recognition system through the integration of a triboelectric touchless sensor and deep learning technology is developed. This system is further applied to control a robot for collecting throat swabs in the noncontact operating mode. Such an intelligent noncontact gesture‐recognition system is promising to make a significant breakthrough in human‐machine interfaces.








Abstract
Human‐machine interfaces (HMIs) play important role in the communication between humans and robots. Touchless HMIs with high hand dexterity and hygiene hold great promise in medical applications, especially during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) to reduce the spread of virus. However, current touchless HMIs are mainly restricted by limited types of gesture recognition, the requirement of wearing accessories, complex sensing platforms, light conditions, and low recognition accuracy, obstructing their practical applications. Here, an intelligent noncontact gesture‐recognition system is presented through the integration of a triboelectric touchless sensor (TTS) and deep learning technology. Combined with a deep‐learning‐based multilayer perceptron neural network, the TTS can recognize 16 different types of gestures with a high average accuracy of 96.5%. The intelligent noncontact gesture‐recognition system is further applied to control a robot for collecting throat swabs in a noncontact mode. Compared with present touchless HMIs, the proposed system can recognize diverse complex gestures by utilizing charges naturally carried on human fingers without the need of wearing accessories, complicated device structures, adequate light conditions, and achieves high recognition accuracy. This system could provide exciting opportunities to develop a new generation of touchless medical equipment, as well as touchless public facilities, smart robots, virtual reality, metaverse, etc.

Till now, varieties of functional materials have been developed for constructing high‐performance memristors. Herein, the review focuses on the emerging 2D MXene materials‐based memristors. First, the mainstream synthetic strategies and characterization methods of MXenes are introduced. Second, the different types of MXene‐based memristive materials and their widely adopted switching mechanisms are overviewed. Third, the recent progress of MXene‐based memristors for data storage, artificial synapses, neuromorphic computing, and logic circuits is comprehensively summarized. Finally, the challenges, development trends, and perspectives are discussed, aiming to provide guidelines for the preparation of novel MXene‐based memristors and more engaging information technology applications.

      <dc:description>
In this review, an overview and future perspective on 1D nanomaterials are introduced. Specifically, various synthetic routes of 1D nanomaterials, analysis of 1D nanomaterials, and application of 1D nanomaterials in energy storage system are highlighted, which broaden the readership. Last, future research directions and perspectives of 1D nanomaterials are presented, which provide an outstanding pathway for more advanced 1D nanomaterials.








Abstract
Due to the unique properties which are considerably different from macro‐scale or bulk materials, 1D) nanostructures have received great interests. In particular, they have greatly contributed to building next‐generation batteries by providing beneficial features such as short ion/electron pathways, structural versatility (i.e., formation of 3D current collectors, free‐standing electrodes, and separators), and excellent stress relaxation. Owing to these definite advantages, 1D nanostructure is often followed by discovery of new electrode materials. This review provides a systematic overview of the state‐of‐the‐art research progresses on 1D nanostructures, which are extensively used for rechargeable batteries. Specifically, a brief introduction of some important 1D nanostructuring methods is started and then, in situ structural characterizations using 1D nanostructures are summarized, which allow a great step forward in atomic‐scale monitoring of reaction kinetics and observing dynamic structural evolution of electrode materials. 1D nanstructuring in solid‐state electrolytes and stabilization of metal anodes are also highlighted which are not only substantially important in current research trends for future batteries but also rarely discussed in previous reviews. At the end, critical perspective and future research direction of 1D nanoengineering for future batteries are suggested.

      <title>Ultraductile Cementitious Structural Health Monitoring Coating: Waterborne Polymer Biomimetic Muscle and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane‐Assisted C‐S‐H Dispersion</title>
      <dc:description>
Long‐term and stable structural health monitoring (SHM) is an effective measure to solve the service issues of eroded concrete “quantitative evaluation of repair”. A series of novel solutions for crack resistance, toughening and monitoring‐durability improvement of cement‐based coating sensors based on organic‐inorganic hybrid technology is adopted, which provides a long‐term scheme for existing infrastructure SHM and its anti‐corrosive protection.








Abstract
Cement‐based sensors (CBSs) have demonstrated potential in structural health monitoring (SHM) despite rare applications due to their poor flexibility and sensing accuracy/protection with robustness. Herein, a promising strategy is reported to design a waterborne epoxy resin (WEP)‐modified cement‐based composite coating sensorcapable of simultaneous stable SHM and durable protection. The interpenetrating network (IPN) formed by WEP within cement paste is bionic to the toughness and crack resistance of biological muscle tissue and balances the ion permeation performance and polarization of hydration products. The polymerization‐redispersion progress and mechanism of calcium silicate hydrate (C‐S‐H) gel modified with [3‐(2‐aminoethylamino)‐propyl]trimethoxysilane silsesquioxane (C‐POSS) are characterized and revealed. The results show that the muscle‐like IPN increases the cement‐based coatings’ maximum deflection angle to 30° and improves the monitoring accuracy of compressive, tensile, and fatigue microchanges of concrete structures to more than 95%. The POSS···Ca2+···C‐S‐H interaction in C‐POSS partially transferred the intra‐adhesive hydrogen bonds surrounding the nanoconducer into electrostatic bridging ones to maintain an excellent electromechanical conductive dispersion.

      <title>A Novel Design Based on Mechanical Time‐Delay Switch and Charge Space Accumulation for High Output Performance Direct‐Current Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
      <dc:description>
A new type DC‐TENG designed by mechanical time‐delay switch and alternating blank‐tribo‐area achieves an ultra‐high output performance and excellent durability, which can effectively collect ambient mechanical energy to construct self‐powered sensing system.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, has become a promising environment energy harvesting technology. However, traditional TENG, based on the coupling of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, generates alternating current (AC) directly, which requires a rectifier to obtain direct current (DC) before being used to drive electronics. There are a few methods to obtain DC output including mechanical rectifier, phase coupling, air breakdown, and Schottky contact. But to achieve high output and high durability of DC‐TENG, new exploration is desired. In this study, a novel DC‐TENG is proposed, which greatly improves the output performance by designing a mechanical time‐delay switch and an alternative blank‐tribo‐area. The working mechanism of the DC‐TENG is analyzed theoretically and verified by experiments. It is found that the blank‐tribo‐area promotes charge accumulation, while the mechanical time‐delay switch realizes DC output. This DC‐TENG can light up 1888 LEDs in series at 60 rpm and drive 24 hygro‐thermographs in parallel with 120 rpm. The ultra‐high average power density of 4.2 W m−2 is achieved, much higher than previous works. The DC‐TENG displays high durability and retains 92% initial output after 120 000 cycles. This st provides a feasible strategy to boost the output performance of DC‐TENG.

Nanowires‐based optoelectronic synaptic devices are suitable for low power consumption neuromorphic applications due to their unique properties. Herein, the typical UV–vis–IR materials are summarized, and the current progress of nanowires‐based optoelectronic synaptic devices in UV–vis–IR spectral range is progressed, including the synaptic functionalities and neuromorphic applications. This review may promote nanowires for future multifunctional neuromorphic optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Simulating biological synaptic functionalities through artificial synaptic devices opens up an innovative way to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck at the device level. Artificial optoelectronic synapses provide a non‐contact method to operate the devices and overcome the shortcomings of electrical synaptic devices. With the advantages of high photoelectric conversion efficiency, adjustable light absorption coefficient, and broad spectral range, nanowires (NWs)‐based optoelectronic synapses have attracted wide attention. Herein, to better promote the applications of nanowires‐based optoelectronic synapses for future neuromorphic systems, the functionalities of optoelectronic synaptic devices and the current progress of NWs optoelectronic synaptic devices in UV–vis–IR spectral range are introduced. Furthermore, a bridge between NWs‐based optoelectronic synaptic device and the neuromorphic system is established. Challenges for the forthcoming development of NWs optoelectronic synapses are also discussed. This review may offer a vision into the design and neuromorphic applications of NWs‐based optoelectronic synaptic devices.

      <title>A Soft, Fast and Versatile Electrohydraulic Gripper with Capacitive Object Size Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
This study presents a new type of electrohydraulic, multi‐material soft gripper that uses an active continuum structure simultaneously as an actuator and a sensor, allowing for grasp detection and object size estimation. The gripper is fast, modular, and robust; using only simple controls inputs it can grip a wide variety of objects, including delicate fruits, without inflicting damage.








Abstract
Soft robotic grippers achieve increased versatility and reduced complexity through intelligence embodied in their flexible and conformal structures. The most widely used soft grippers are pneumatically driven; they are simple and effective but require bulky air compressors that limit their application space and external sensors or computationally expensive vision systems for pick verification. In this study, a multi‐material architecture for self‐sensing electrohydraulic bending actuators is presented that enables a new class of highly versatile and reconfigurable soft grippers that are electrically driven and feature capacitive pick verification and object size detection. These electrohydraulic grippers are fast (step input results in finger closure in 50 ms), draw low power (6.5 mW per finger to hold grasp), and can pick a wide variety of objects with simple binary electrical control. Integrated high‐voltage driving electronics are presented that greatly increase the application space of the grippers and make them readily compatible with commercially available robotic arms.

This study presents a new type of electrohydraulic, multi‐material soft gripper that uses an active continuum structure simultaneously as an actuator and a sensor, allowing for grasp detection and object size estimation. The gripper is fast, modular, and robust; using only simple controls inputs it can grip a wide variety of objects, including delicate fruits, without inflicting damage.








Abstract
Soft robotic grippers achieve increased versatility and reduced complexity through intelligence embodied in their flexible and conformal structures. The most widely used soft grippers are pneumatically driven; they are simple and effective but require bulky air compressors that limit their application space and external sensors or computationally expensive vision systems for pick verification. In this study, a multi‐material architecture for self‐sensing electrohydraulic bending actuators is presented that enables a new class of highly versatile and reconfigurable soft grippers that are electrically driven and feature capacitive pick verification and object size detection. These electrohydraulic grippers are fast (step input results in finger closure in 50 ms), draw low power (6.5 mW per finger to hold grasp), and can pick a wide variety of objects with simple binary electrical control. Integrated high‐voltage driving electronics are presented that greatly increase the application space of the grippers and make them readily compatible with commercially available robotic arms.

      <title>Determinant Role of Solution‐State Supramolecular Assembly in Molecular Orientation of Conjugated Polymer Films</title>
      <dc:description>
The possible origin of packing‐orientation formation in conjugated polymer films is unraveled. The solution‐state supramolecular structure of conjugated polymers, with the observation of reversible dimensionality transition, is found to play predominant roles in the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively.








Abstract
The solid‐state molecular orientation of conjugated polymers is of vital importance for their charge transport properties, where the edge‐on orientation with π‐stacking direction parallel to the surface is generally preferable to achieving high‐mobility planar field‐effect transistors. However, so far, little is known about the origin of packing‐orientation formation in thin films. Here, it is shown that the solution‐state supramolecular structure of widely studied PffBT4T‐based polymers can be reversibly tuned between 1D worm‐like and 2D lamellar structures for the same polymer/solvent system through solution temperature. Such dimensionality in solution determines the solid‐state packing orientation of the polymer chains, where edge‐on and face‐on textures are generated from solutions with 1D and 2D structures, respectively. More importantly, the transition temperature of solution‐state supramolecular dimensionality is in excellent agreement with that of solid‐state packing orientation. These experimental observations unambiguously demonstrate the predominant roles of solution‐state supramolecular assembly in solid‐state molecular orientation, which is further verified using different molecular weight batches and other two representative polymers. The findings provide new insights into the growth mechanism of polymer semiconductors during transistor fabrication, and open prospective pathways for boosting device performance of solution‐processable plastic electronics.

      <title>Repair Strategies and Bioactive Functional Materials for Intervertebral Disc</title>
      <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and future prospects of repair strategies and materials for the intervertebral disc are reviewed, highlighting and summarizing the latest advances of main repairing strategies and functional materials for disc degeneration repair, to provide a reference for the following relevant studies.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the leading cause of low back pain, which represents a highly prevalent chronic aging‐associated disorder with a large socio‐economic burden and a great decline in the quality of life, contributing to the pressing need for IVD treatments. Thus, finding effective disease‐modifying approaches for postponing the progression of IVD degeneration and repairing degenerated intervertebral discs is of great importance, even facing various challengeable obstacles. Bioactive functional materials exhibit excellent advances in modulating cell activity and remodeling tissue homeostasis, which acts as a promising and accessible therapeutic approach to tissue repair and organ reconstruction. Recently, these have been notably explored to investigate bioactive functional materials‐based repair strategies for intervertebral disc recovery and regeneration, including cell‐based tissue engineering, the development of implants for disc recovery, and therapeutic methods for remodeling the functional integrity of the IVD. This review summarizes the advanced progress of bioactive functional materials in IVD repair and regeneration, and discusses their regulatory mechanisms, limitations, challenges as well as their clinical translational prospects in the future.

      <title>Orientation Independent Growth of Uniform Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Thin Films on Silicon for High‐Density 3D Memory Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Here, the substrate‐orientation independent growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films is realized with uniform ferroelectricity by using HfO2 seed layers. Further device simulation studies suggest that the proposed scheme contributes to realizing uniform memory properties in 3D vertical HZO‐based ferroelectric field‐effect transistors.








Abstract
The highly scalable ferroelectric hafnia‐based thin films can be easily integrated into ferroelectric field‐effect transistors (FeFETs) by existing Si technology, which are regarded as one of the promising candidates for fast read/write, energy‐efficient, and high‐density nonvolatile memories. However, device‐to‐device variation in threshold voltage (VTH) caused by non‐uniformity of ferroelectric properties is a serious challenge for implementing hafnia‐based FeFETs in high‐density nonvolatile memories. Here, the substrate‐orientation independent growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films is realized with uniform ferroelectricity by using HfO2 seed layers. The HfO2 seed layers are beneficial to improving the ferroelectric polarization of HZO thin films grown on differently oriented Si substrates and reducing the variation in ferroelectric properties. Moreover, device simulation confirms that the proposed scheme contributes to realizing uniform memory properties in 3D vertical HZO‐based FeFETs. This study suggests the possibility to implement hafnia‐based FeFETs into 3D vertical high‐density memory.

      <title>Physical Cue‐Based Strategies on Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
In this review, the physical cue‐based strategies, including electrical, acoustic, magnetic, and morphology, to the pathological improvement and regenerative licensing following peripheral nerve injury is systematically outlined. The typical studies are comprehensively summarized and dissected with an emphasis on their strategy conception and realization modalities and envision its prospects in the future.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) remains an intractable challenge in regenerative medicine. Recently, physical cue‐based strategies (e.g., electrical neurostimulation, acoustic radiation, electromagnetic bioregulation, as well as directional fiber guiding, etc.) have drawn increasing attention not only as a stimulator for cell functions modulation and fate determination, but also as a morphology‐index for modulating cell phenotype, proliferation, and differentiation, especially for nerve cells. More importantly, the advanced percutaneous power transmission technology, self‐power nanotechnology that leverages piezoelectrical/triboelectricity materials, and focused ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field technology exhibit the appealing practice potential for achieving low‐invasive, wireless, and battery‐free neuromodulation. In this review, recent advances of physical cue‐based strategies including electrical, acoustic, magnetic, and morphology for PNI are systematically overviewed, and the open challenges for realizing scalable clinical/commercial transformation and future perspectives of these strategies for PNI are concluded.

      <title>High‐Performance Phototransistor Based on Graphene/Organic Heterostructure for In‐Chip Visual Processing and Pulse Monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>
In this work, a graphene/bulk heterojunction phototransistor is presented for applications as photodetector, vision sensor, and pulse sensor for the first time. The phototransistor has a gate‐tunable bi‐directional photoresponse for in‐chip image processing. Moreover, the phototransistor can monitor human pulse signal and heart rate in real time. This work paves the way for the future development of multifunction artificial retinas.








Abstract
Mimicking the real‐time sensing and processing capabilities of human retina opens up a promising pathway for achieving vision chips with high‐efficient image processing. The development of retina‐inspired vision chip also requires hardware with high sensitivity, fast image capture, and the ability to sense under various lighting conditions. Herein, a high‐performance phototransistor based on graphene/organic heterojunction is demonstrated with a superior responsivity (2.86 × 106 A W−1), an outstanding respond speed (rise time/fall time is 20 µs/8.4 ms), and a remarkable detectivity (1.47 × 1014 Jones) at 650 nm. The phototransistor combines weak‐light detection capability (minimum detectable light intensity down to 2.8 nW cm−2) with gate‐tunable bi‐directional photoresponse capable of simultaneously sensing and processing visual images for light intensities ranging over six orders magnitude (10–107nW cm−2). Moreover, the phototransistor also exhibits an intriguing feature undiscovered in other retina‐inspired devices, namely that it can real‐time monitor the human pulse signal and heart rate by using photoplethysmography technology, and the measured heart rate error is only 0.87% compared with a commercially available sensor. This work paves the way for the development of low‐light and bio‐signal sensitive artificial retinas in the future.

      <title>Hierarchically Designed Super‐Elastic Metafabric for Thermal‐Wet Comfortable and Antibacterial Epidermal Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>
A super‐elastic epidermal electrode with tight inter‐layer adhesion and compact device integration is rationally developed on a hierarchical metafabric with porosity–wettability asymmetries and stretchable liquid‐metal circuits, which simultaneously achieves diverse functionalities including unidirectional perspiration wicking, robust antibacterial property, low‐watt heating ability, and high‐fidelity detectability of human electromyography signals.








Abstract
On‐skin electronic systems represent a burgeoning technology that develops wearable devices capable of adapting to the dynamic surfaces of the human body. Present film‐based electronics are constrained to single‐layered constructions on impermeable substrates that severely inhibit their wearing comfort and multi‐functionality. Herein, a thermal‐wet comfortable and antibacterial epidermal electrode is hierarchically designed on an ultra‐stretchable metafabric. Via the layer‐by‐layer assembly of trilayered elastomeric fibers with multi‐scale sizes and varied compositions, porosity and wettability asymmetries are established across the nonwoven fabric, rendering it with unidirectional liquid conduction and sweat self‐pumping performance. The successful printing of stretchable liquid‐metal (EGaIn) circuits on ZnO NPs anchored microfibers simultaneously equips the trilayered metafabric with robust antibacterial capability, low‐watt heating ability, and high‐fidelity detectability for surface electromyography signals of various physical activities. Moreover, the incorporation of thermochromic microcapsules in the outmost fibers also enables the fabric Joule heater with visual indicating ability via reversible color‐switching. Thus, this hierarchically engineered epidermal electrode with thermal‐wet comfort and antibacterial ability holds great promise in daily applicable healthcare and sports monitoring electronics.

      <dc:description>
The material characteristics, preparation methods, motion behaviors, and driving mechanisms of chemically driven micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are summarized in this review. A summary of current developments in chemically driven MNRs research is provided from the perspectives of drug delivery, disease diagnosis, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, gastrointestinal therapy, and cancer therapy.

Abstract
Micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are capable of autonomous motion, breaking through the limitations of traditional passive transport of nanocarriers. Among them, chemically driven MNRs are the earliest MNRs studied and have received extensive attention from researchers. This review first focuses on the material properties, preparation, driving forms, and mechanisms of chemically driven MNRs. The current status of research on chemically driven MNRs in biomedicine is summarized for various biological applications (drug delivery, diagnostics, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, and disease treatment). In terms of biosafety, possible safety issues are analyzed in the context of chemically driven microrobotic applications in terms of three aspects: component characteristics, chemical engines and biological environment. Finally, the challenges and possible future directions of chemically driven MNRs are presented.

      <title>Flexible ZnO Nanosheet‐Based Artificial Synapses Prepared by Low‐Temperature Process for High Recognition Accuracy Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <dc:description>
The ZnO NS‐based artificial synapses are prepared at low temperature by a simple spin coating process. Combining various characterization techniques and data analysis, the weight transition process in artificial synapses is recognized, In addition, the typical synaptic plasticity and high recognition accuracy are realized and kept stable under a series of bending operations.








Abstract
In neuromorphic computing networks, a flexible synaptic memristor with high recognition accuracy is highly desired. In this study, ZnO nanosheets (ZnO NS) embedded within a polymethyl methacrylate host material are used as the intermediate layer to prepare flexible synaptic memristor at a low‐temperature of 80 °C. The device shows excellent switching characteristics with low SET/RESET voltages (−0.4 V/0.4 V) and stable retention characteristic (104 s). By modulating the conductance continuously, the flexible synaptic memristor simulates typical synaptic plasticities, including excitation post‐synaptic current, paired‐pulse facilitation, and spike‐timing dependent plasticity. Especially, the neuromorphic system built from flexible ZnO NS‐based memristors achieves a high recognition accuracy up to 97.7% for handwriting digit. Under the influence of 5% Uniform noise and 5% Gaussian noise, recognition accuracies are maintained at 94.6% and 93.7%, respectively. These properties are well maintained even when bending 1000 times at a radius of 5 mm. The flexible ZnO NS‐based memristor shows great prospects in wearable devices and neural morphology calculation.

      <title>Controlled Synthesis of Multicolor Carbon Dots Assisted by Machine Learning</title>
      <dc:description>
A data‐driven machine learning strategy is developed to efficiently and accurately guide the synthesis of multicolor CDs with excellent photoluminescence properties. The correlation between the reaction parameters and the photoluminescence properties of CDs is investigated.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received extensive attention and applications in recent years due to their remarkable characteristics of tunable emission wavelength, high stability, and a variety of synthetic raw materials. Since the formation process and photoluminescence properties of CDs are affected by multiple factors, the luminescence regulation of CDs has always been a troublesome problem. Furthermore, it is still a lack of appropriate approaches to reveal the hidden rules between the synthesis conditions and the luminescence properties of CDs. Inspired by machine learning (ML) applications in molecular and materials science, herein, a data‐driven ML strategy is proposed to multi‐dimensionally investigate the correlation between reaction parameters and the photoluminescence properties of CDs. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that reaction parameters and solvent properties have different influences on the fluorescence properties of CDs, and the intelligently optimizing synthesis route of CDs is achieved using ML algorithms. CDs with excellent luminescent properties screened by ML are further applied to high‐capacity colorful information encryption. This work provides an efficient ML‐assisted strategy to guide the synthesis of multicolor CDs, helping researchers to quickly and easily obtain CDs according to experimental requirements.

      <title>Bioinspired Machine‐Learning‐Assisted Early‐Fire Perception System Based on VO2 Optical Switch</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by brain‐centered perception processes, a machine‐learning‐assistant early fire perception system is demonstrated that can demodulate multiple fire signals and achieve early warning, fire cause identification, and evacuation advice provides. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first fire perception system featuring real‐time processing abilities with achieving early warning, fire cause identification, and evacuation advice provides.








Abstract
The continuation of human civilization has always been accompanied by symbiosis and confrontation with fire. Particularly, humans can comprehensively recognize fire situations based on various sensory receptors in organs (eyes, skin, nose, etc.), further forming a sound fire perception system by in‐the‐brain recording, modeling, and understanding fire behaviors, leading to the most accurate fire treatments. If a sensing perception system can mimic human perceptual behavior and carry out real‐time fire recognition, such an active defense system can achieve real fire safety. Here, inspired by the brain‐centered perception system, an early‐fire perception system enabled by a VO2‐based temperature‐flame‐modulated optical switch, and a machine‐learning‐assistant demodulation algorithm is reported. This approach creates real‐time monitoring composed of early fire warning (1 s for candle flame and 4 s for 130 °C heat flow), fire cause recognition (95.7% accuracy in identification), and evacuation advice provision, advancing the technologies in the perception system that enable future sensors the comprehensive perception capability for fire state.

      <title>Shape‐Deformable and Locomotive MXene (Ti3C2Tx)‐Encapsulated Magnetic Liquid Metal for 3D‐Motion‐Adaptive Synapses</title>
      <dc:description>
An Ti3C2Tx (MXene)‐encapsulated magnetic liquid metal (MX–MLM) is synthesized for application to 3D‐motion‐adaptive synapses. The MX–MLM exhibits magnetic‐field‐induced shape deformability, locomotion, self‐healability, recyclability, and nonwettability and has excellent potential for application to single‐neural‐network artificial‐intelligence‐based magnetic‐path‐tracking systems to simultaneously sense, learn, and adapt to different magnetic fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique surface chemistry, room‐temperature pseudoliquidity, and high electrical conductivity, gallium‐based liquid metals (LMs) exhibit multifunctionality. To grant deformable and self‐flowing characteristics to LMs, magnetic particles are incorporated for precisely controlling the LM motion and shape deformability. However, LM surface‐adhesion and corrosivity hinders the integration of LMs into complex circuits and devices owing to potential alloying with other metals and contamination of their surroundings. In this study, a highly conductive Ti3C2Tx (MXene)‐encapsulated magnetic LM (MX–MLM) is developed using a feasible fabrication method. The MX–MLM comprises magnetic particles suspended within its core and self‐assembled MXene flakes on the surface to maintain the nonwettability and high electrical conductivity of a liquid droplet. The noncorrosivity and increased magnetism of the MX–MLM enable nonstick magnetic‐field‐induced locomotion and shape deformation on various surfaces including metals, oxides, and polymers. Furthermore, the MX–MLM exhibits recyclability and magnetic‐field‐induced self‐healing. To demonstrate its functionality, the MX–MLM is employed as a magnetointeractive, shape‐deformable, and locomotive top gate electrode in a transistor fabricated using a ferroelectric polymer gate insulator. The device exhibits excellent magnetointeractive synaptic capability for detecting and learning 3D path information.

      <title>Chiroptical 3D Actuators for Smart Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
The programmed in‐planar and out‐of‐planar heterogeneous assembly of chiroptically and mechanically active layers show the ability to reversible shape morphing and structural color signaling that is applied to the methanol‐laced water identifier.








Abstract
Examples of anisotropic movement paired with helical geometry abound in the animal and plant kingdoms are used for a variety of reasons, such as diverse social signaling directed at conspecifics or camouflage to avoid predation. Inspired by these natural phenomena, a smart sensor is developed with a chiroptical 3D actuator that can fold, bend, and twist in response to external stimuli, reflecting light of specific wavelengths, and possessing circular polarization properties. Chirophotonic crystal actuators are constructed with an asymmetric Janus structure and are fabricated by self‐assembly, screen printing, and in situ photopolymerization. The optically active layer consists of cholesteric liquid crystal polymer, and the mechanically active layer is composed of a polymeric gel thin film. The programmed in‐planar and out‐of‐planar asymmetric Janus structures control the directionality of various shapes morphing from 2D to 3D. Finite element simulations allow to predict the shape changes associated with these chirophotonic crystal actuators: flower blooming, tendril climbing, eagle hunting, ant lifting, and inchworm moving motions. By utilizing the chirophotonic crystal actuator, a reusable and portable methanol‐laced water identifier is developed.

      <title>Fouling‐Proof Cooling (FP‐Cool) Fabric Hybrid with Enhanced Sweat‐Elimination and Heat‐Dissipation for Personal Thermal Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A fouling‐proof cooling (FP‐Cool) fabric that integrates with oil/water‐repellent and excellent passive cooling capacities is proposed by constructing superoleophobic Janus channels on heat‐conductive enhanced superomniphobic fabric. The FP‐Cool fabric preserves 40% higher thermal conductivity and over 50% higher evaporation rate than conventional fabrics. Moreover, the FP‐Cool keeps its anti‐fouling and sweat‐wicking/evaporation properties even after 3000 cycles of abrasion test.








Abstract
Passive cooling fabric that facilitates sweat‐wicking and evaporation is highly desirable for promoting human body's thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption. However, highly hydrophilic sweat‐wicking fabric fails to repel external fouling due to the contradiction between hydrophilicity and lyophobicity. Moreover, conventional passive cooling fabrics show limited evaporation capacity when they reach the adsorption limit in intense perspiration scenarios.

A fouling‐proof cooling (FP‐Cool) fabric that integrates with oil/water‐repellent and excellent passive cooling capacities is proposed by constructing superoleophobic Janus channels on heat‐conductive enhanced superomniphobic fabric. The FP‐Cool fabric preserves 40% higher thermal conductivity and over 50% higher evaporation rate than conventional fabrics. Moreover, the FP‐Cool keeps its anti‐fouling and sweat‐wicking/evaporation properties even after 3000 cycles of abrasion test.








Abstract
Passive cooling fabric that facilitates sweat‐wicking and evaporation is highly desirable for promoting human body's thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption. However, highly hydrophilic sweat‐wicking fabric fails to repel external fouling due to the contradiction between hydrophilicity and lyophobicity. Moreover, conventional passive cooling fabrics show limited evaporation capacity when they reach the adsorption limit in intense perspiration scenarios. Herein, a fouling‐proof cooling (FP‐Cool) fabric with an interactive functional structure design for highly‐efficient personal thermal regulation is proposed by constructing spatially distributed superoleophobic Janus channels on an optimized heat conductive superomniphobic fabric. The dominant superomniphobicity and superoleophobic Janus feature endow the outer FP‐Cool fabric with durable performance (up to 3000 cycles’ abrasion) to repel oil/water‐based contaminations. The Janus channels rapidly pull sweat out of the inner fabric for efficient evaporation, ensuring a dry sense of skin. The FP‐Cool fabric preserves 40% higher thermal conductivity, and over 50% higher evaporation rate than conventional fabrics. In the sweat evaporation test, the FP‐Cool fabric shows up to 100% reduction in sweat gain ratio to cotton fabric. The concept would have implications for intelligent textiles design, and the synthesis strategy can be applied in various applications such as oil‐water separation and microfluidics control.

      <title>Alternating Growth for InSitu Post‐Programing Hydrogels’ Sizes and Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Acid–base complex hydrogels made of acidic (A) and basic (B) monomers can continuously integrate their parent monomers to grow, which leads to tunable size, shape, composition, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Growing polymer materials emerge as a class of new intelligent systems, but they are all covalently cross‐linked. Herein, an alternating growth strategy for enabling tough supramolecular hydrogels is described to integrate externally provided compounds to change their sizes, geometric shapes, mechanical properties, etc. The hydrogels have dynamic acid–base complex (ABC) structures made from acidic and basic monomers, in which the acid–base pairs equilibrate between ionic and nonionic states to show either strong electrostatic or weak acid–base interactions. The growth process includes swelling of acidic/basic monomers, polymerization of the absorbed monomers, and homogenization of the original and newborn polymers, in which the balance between electrostatic and acid–base interactions is reversibly shifted to enable the process. As a result of such repeatable growth cycles, the hydrogels can continuously expand without compromising material mechanical properties. The growing sub‐processes and the monomer compositions can be used to post‐modulate the structure and properties of the grown products. It is demonstrated that the hydrogels may be designed as artificial tissues capable of growth under force‐bearing states.

      <title>Within or Without You? A Perspective Comparing In Situ and Ex Situ Tissue Engineering Strategies for Articular Cartilage Repair</title>
      <dc:description>
This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art of bioengineering for articular cartilage. Here the intricacies of articular cartilage bioengineering are described, exploring in depth the advances and disadvantages of two strategies of delivering stem cell based approaches, namely, the direct “in situ” delivery and the more traditional bench‐based strategy.








Abstract
Human articular cartilage has a poor ability to self‐repair, meaning small injuries often lead to osteoarthritis, a painful and debilitating condition which is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Existing clinical strategies generally do not regenerate hyaline type cartilage, motivating research toward tissue engineering solutions. Prospective cartilage tissue engineering therapies can be placed into two broad categories: i) Ex situ strategies, where cartilage tissue constructs are engineered in the lab prior to implantation and ii) in situ strategies, where cells and/or a bioscaffold are delivered to the defect site to stimulate chondral repair directly. While commonalities exist between these two approaches, the core point of distinction—whether chondrogenesis primarily occurs “within” or “without” (outside) the body—can dictate many aspects of the treatment. This difference influences decisions around cell selection, the biomaterials formulation and the surgical implantation procedure, the processes of tissue integration and maturation, as well as, the prospects for regulatory clearance and clinical translation. Here, ex situ and in situ cartilage engineering strategies are compared: Highlighting their respective challenges, opportunities, and prospects on their translational pathways toward long term human cartilage repair.

      <title>Magnetic Nanodroplets for Enhanced Deep Penetration of Solid Tumors and Simultaneous Magnetothermal‐Sensitized Immunotherapy against Tumor Proliferation and Metastasis</title>
      <dc:description>
In this manuscript, magnetic nanolipid droplets (MNDs) for treating the cells in deep regions of solid tumors are reported. This work introduces a distinct application of nanoultrasonic biomedicine in cancer therapy and provides an attractive immunotherapy strategy (SMSI) for preventing the proliferation and metastasis of deeply distributed cells in solid tumors.








Abstract
The central cells of solid tumors are more proliferative and metastatic than the marginal cells. Therefore, more intelligent strategies for targeting cells with deep spatial distributions in solid tumors remain to be explored. In this work, a biocompatible nanotheranostic agent with a lipid membrane‐coated, Fe3O4 and perfluoropentane (PFP)‐loaded, cRGD peptide (specifically targeting the integrin αvβ3 receptor)‐grafted, magnetic nanodroplets (MNDs) is developed. The MNDs exhibit excellent magnetothermal conversion and controllable magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) through alternating magnetic field regulation. Furthermore, MHT‐mediated magnetic droplet vaporization (MDV) induces the expansion of the MNDs to transform them into ultrasonic microbubbles, increasing the permeability of tissue and the cell membrane via the ultrasound‐targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique and thereby promoting the deep penetration of MNDs in solid tumors. More importantly, MHT not only causes apoptotic damage by downregulating the expression of the HSP70, cyclin D1, and Bcl‐2 proteins in tumor cells but also improves the response rate to T‐cell‐related immunotherapy by upregulating PD‐L1 expression in tumor cells, thus inhibiting the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of nanoultrasonic biomedicine in cancer therapy and provides an attractive immunotherapy strategy for preventing the proliferation and metastasis of deeply distributed cells in solid tumors.

      <title>Shining a Light on Cancer—Photonics in Microfluidic Tumor Modeling and Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>
In this paper, Guimarães et al. review light‐driven technologies in microfluidic cancer models. Starting with an overview of how light can aid in the assembly and fabrication of cancer microarchitectures, the authors then look to the role of photonics in the quantification of cancer responses and markers from a biosensing perspective, with a focus in microfluidic platforms.








Abstract
Microfluidic platforms represent a powerful approach to miniaturizing important characteristics of cancers, improving in vitro testing by increasing physiological relevance. Different tools can manipulate cells and materials at the microscale, but few offer the efficiency and versatility of light and optical technologies. Moreover, light‐driven technologies englobe a broad toolbox for quantifying critical biological phenomena. Herein, the role of photonics in microfluidic 3D cancer modeling and biosensing from three major perspectives is reviewed. First, optical‐driven technologies are looked upon, as these allow biomaterials and living cells to be manipulated with microsized precision and present opportunities to advance 3D microfluidic models by engineering cancer microenvironments' hallmarks, such as their architecture, cellular complexity, and vascularization. Second, the growing field of optofluidics is discussed, exploring how optical tools can directly interface microfluidic chips, enabling the extraction of relevant biological data, from single fluorescent signals to the complete 3D imaging of diseased cells within microchannels. Third, advances in optical cancer biosensing are reviewed, focusing on how light–matter interactions can detect biomarkers, rare circulating tumor cells, and cell‐derived structures such as exosomes. Photonic technologies' current challenges and caveats in microfluidic 3D cancer models are overviewed, outlining future research avenues that may catapult the field.

The state‐of‐the‐art advances in the development and use of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines in different biomedical applications are systematically summarized, concentrating on endogenous activators, exogenous stimuli, and the integration of endogenous and exogenous triggers to augment the efficacy of biomaterial‐ or nanomedicine‐enabled catalytic treatments.

Abstract
Catalytic therapy can concurrently enhance therapeutic efficacy and decrease side effects by converting less toxic or nontoxic endogenous substances into various highly toxic reactive species (e.g., toxic radicals) to induce cell apoptosis/necrosis, which has been exploited to combat different types of diseases. As material science and nanotechnology evolve for application in disease therapies, a variety of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines have been elaborately designed and synthesized to mediate catalytic reactions and/or enhance the corresponding catalytic treatment efficacy. This review systematically summarizes, outlines, and discusses the state‐of‐the‐art advances in the development and use of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines in diverse biomedical applications, particularly concentrating on their endogenous activators, exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, heat, ultrasound, and magnetic field), and the integration of endogenous and exogenous triggers to improve the efficacy of biomaterial/nanomedicine‐enabled catalytic treatments. The biosafety and biocompatibility of various catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines for biomedical applications are also discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for advancement of catalytic biomaterials and nanomedicines are highlighted, aiming to boost their early fulfillment of practical clinical applications.

      <title>Wearable Hydrogel‐Based Epidermal Sensor with Thermal Compatibility and Long Term Stability for Smart Colorimetric Multi‐Signals Monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>
Herein, wearable transparent epidermal sensors with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring are successfully developed. These freestanding wearable epidermal sensors are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner.








Abstract
Hydrogel‐based wearable epidermal sensors (HWESs) have attracted widespread attention in health monitoring, especially considering their colorimetric readout capability. However, it remains challenging for HWESs to work at extreme temperatures with long term stability due to the existence of water. Herein, a wearable transparent epidermal sensor with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring is developed, based on an anti‐freezing and anti‐drying hydrogel with high transparency (over 90% transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1500%) and desirable adhesiveness to various kinds of substrates. The hydrogel consists of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and tannic acid‐coated cellulose nanocrystals in glycerin/water binary solvents. When glycerin readily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, the hydrogel exhibits outstanding thermal compatibility. Furthermore, the hydrogel maintains excellent adhesion, stretchability, and transparency after long term storage (45 days) or at subzero temperatures (−20 °C). For smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring, the freestanding smart colorimetric HWESs are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner. In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi‐signals with visible readouts in long term health monitoring.

Herein, wearable transparent epidermal sensors with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring are successfully developed. These freestanding wearable epidermal sensors are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner.








Abstract
Hydrogel‐based wearable epidermal sensors (HWESs) have attracted widespread attention in health monitoring, especially considering their colorimetric readout capability. However, it remains challenging for HWESs to work at extreme temperatures with long term stability due to the existence of water. Herein, a wearable transparent epidermal sensor with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring is developed, based on an anti‐freezing and anti‐drying hydrogel with high transparency (over 90% transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1500%) and desirable adhesiveness to various kinds of substrates. The hydrogel consists of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and tannic acid‐coated cellulose nanocrystals in glycerin/water binary solvents. When glycerin readily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, the hydrogel exhibits outstanding thermal compatibility. Furthermore, the hydrogel maintains excellent adhesion, stretchability, and transparency after long term storage (45 days) or at subzero temperatures (−20 °C). For smart colorimetric multi‐signals monitoring, the freestanding smart colorimetric HWESs are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner. In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi‐signals with visible readouts in long term health monitoring.

      <title>3D‐printed Radiopaque Microdevices with Enhanced Mucoadhesive Geometry for Oral Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
During the past decades, microdevices have been evaluated as a means to overcome challenges within oral drug delivery, thus improving bioavailability. Fabrication of microdevices is often limited to planar or simple 3D designs. Therefore, this work explores how microscale stereolithography 3D printing can be used to fabricate radiopaque microcontainers with enhanced mucoadhesive geometries, which can enhance bioavailability by increasing gastrointestinal retention. Ex vivo force measurements suggest increased mucoadhesion of microcontainers with adhering features, such as pillars and arrows, compared to a neutral design. In vivo studies, utilizing planar x‐ray imaging, show time dependent gastrointestinal location of microcontainers, whereas computed tomography scanning and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy reveal information about their spatial dynamics and mucosal interactions. For the first time, the effect of 3D microdevice modifications on gastrointestinal retention is traced in vivo, and the applied methods provide a much‐needed approach for investigating the impact of device design on gastrointestinal retention.

      <title>Selective Formation of Osteogenic and Vasculogenic Tissues for Cartilage Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrodeposition strategy is reported, which enables the selective formation of tissue‐engineered periosteum substitutes with osteoprogenitor and vascular niche in the multiphasic scaffold in combination with different human cell types for articular cartilage regeneration in an orthotopic in vivo platform.








Abstract
Tissue‐engineered periosteum substitutes (TEPSs) incorporating hierarchical architecture with osteoprogenitor and vascular niches are drawing much attention as a promising tool to support functional cells in defined zones and nourish the cortical bone. Current TEPSs usually lack technologies to closely observe cell performance, especially at the cell contact interface between distinct compartments containing defined biological configurations and functions. Here, an electrodeposition strategy is reported, which enables the selective formation of TEPSs with osteoprogenitor and vascular niches in a multiphasic scaffold in combination with different human cell types for cartilage regeneration in an in vivo osteochondral defect model. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are used to mirror both the vascular and osteogenic niches, respectively. It is observed that the intrinsic viscoelastic nature of the porous solid matrix is essential to successfully induce angiogenesis. Coculture of hMSCs with functional cells (HUVECs/HDFs) in TEPSs also effectively promoted periosteal regeneration, including osteogenic and angiogenic processes. The osteoarthritis cartilage histopathology assessment and histologic/histochemical grading system data indicate that the TEPSs containing hMSCs/HUVECs/HDFs exhibit superior potential for cartilage regeneration.

      <title>A Review of Recent Progress on Collagen‐Based Biomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Collagen‐based biomaterials (CBBs) have been confirmed to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue‐engineered scaffolds, etc. This review, combined with the situation in China, provides thorough strides in CBBs structures, cross‐linking, forming technologies, real‐world applications, and the underlying development directions, which is beneficial for the exploration of the development strategy, and international reach of China's collagen industry.








Abstract
Since the 2010s, the demand for healthcare models has exceeded the prevailing resources available due to the rapid increase in the aging population in China. However, a significant gap in development of biomedical materials remains, especially between China and the western developed countries. Collagen is the major protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been extensively applied in medical fields. Collagen‐based biomaterials (CBBs) are used to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue‐engineered scaffolds, and drug delivery systems; this is attributed to their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, hypoimmunogenicity, and coordination between collagen hosts and tissues. This review provides thorough strides in CBB structures, crosslinking and forming technologies, and real‐world applications. First, the natural origin and specific structures of animal‐derived collagen and non‐animal‐derived collagen are introduced and compared. Second, crosslinking methods and forming technologies of CBBs across the board are discussed. Third, several examples are considered to demonstrate the practical biomedical use of CBBs and highlight cautionary notes. Finally, the underlying development directions of CBBs from an interdisciplinary perspective are outlined. This review aims to provide comprehensive mechanisms by which collagen can be uniquely and practically used as advanced biomaterial, hence providing options for augmenting its development in China.

      <title>Patterned Duplex Fibric based on Genetically Modified Spidroin for Smart Wound Management</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The treatment of diabetic wounds remains a great challenge for the medical community. Here; a smart patterned DNA double helix (duplex)‐like fabric based on genetically modified spider silk protein (PDF‐S); which was inspired by soft plant tendrils; is proposed for diabetic wound treatment. Benefiting from spider silk protein (spidroin); PDF‐S is equipped with high strength; high toughness and excellent biocompatibility. Notably; the fabric crimped through the biomimetic DNA double helix‐like structure can effectively adapt to tensile impact; and the maximum stretch rate reaches 1500%. A pattern‐based microfluidic channel of PDF‐S allowed wound secretion to flow spontaneously through the channel. Meanwhile; due to the optical properties of the introduced photonic crystal (PC) structure; PDF‐S is equipped with fluorescence enhancement properties; enabling PDF‐S to display color‐sensitive behavior suitable for wound monitoring and guiding clinical treatment. In addition; to enable sensitive motion monitoring; microelectronic circuits are integrated on the surface of the PDF‐S. These unique material features suggest that this study will lead to a new generation of biomimetic artificial spider silk materials for design and application in the biomedical field.

      <title>LBL Noninvasively‐Peelable Biointerfacial Adhesives for Cutaneo‐Inspired pH/Tactility Artificial Receptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Besides barrier functions, skin possesses multiple sentiences to external stimuli (e.g., temperature, force, and humidity) for human‐outside interaction. Thus, skincare should be taken very seriously, especially by patients with sensory disorders. However, currently available skin‐mimicking devices are always limited by so insufficient response functions and non‐tunable interface behaviors as not to realize precise health monitoring and self‐defense against injury. Herein, we present a bioinspired cutaneous receptor‐perceptual system (CRPS) patch, integrating hybrid pH indicators and triboelectric nanogenerators into biointerface film‐adhesives that are fabricated through facile layer‐by‐layer (LBL) self‐assembly of amide and Schiff‐base linkages between alginate grafted with N‐hydroxysuccinimide ester (AN), tannic acid (TA) and polyethylenimine (PEI). This CRPS patch is adhered robustly to the soft‐curved skin surface without failure via “molecular suturing”, and amino acid enables its benign peel‐on‐demand from tissue interfaces. Post‐damage self‐healing brings it without surgical re‐operation, avoiding extra cost, pain, as well as infection risks. Significantly, CRPS patches as artificial chemo/mechano‐receptors can remotely visualize skin physiological status by pH‐induced chromism using smartphones and prevent skin contact injury by tactility‐driven self‐powered electrical signals. Overall, our LBL‐based strategy to create controllably biointerface‐adhesive CRPS patches will usher in a new era of the mobihealth care platform supporting smart diagnosis and self‐protection.

      <title>Recent Progress in Carrier‐Free Nanomedicine for Tumor Phototherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Safe and effective strategies are urgently needed to fight against the life‐threatening diseases of various cancers. However, traditional therapeutic modalities, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery, exhibit suboptimal efficacy for malignant tumors owing to the serious side effect, drug resistance and even relapse. Phototherapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), are emerging therapeutic strategies for localized tumor inhibition, which can produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or elevate the temperature to initiate cell death by non‐invasive irradiation. In consideration of the poor bioavailability of phototherapy agents (PTAs), lots of drug delivery systems have been developed to enhance the tumor targeted delivery. Nevertheless, the carriers of drug delivery systems inevitably bring biosafety concerns on account of their metabolism, degradation and accumulation. Of note, carrier‐free nanomedicine attracts great attention for clinical translation with synergistic antitumor effect, which is characterized by high drug loading, simplified synthetic method and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize the latest advances of phototherapy with various carrier‐free nanomedicines, which may provide a new paradigm for the future development of nanomedicine and tumor precision therapy.

The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer‐scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high‐performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon‐compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all‐in‐one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer‐scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

      <title>Chirality in Light–Matter Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in nanofabricated optical metamaterials designed to enhance the interaction between optical and structural chirality are explored, focusing on the role of chirality in biological systems and its use in current biosensing applications. Additionally, the recent introduction of machine‐learning algorithms to the design of chiral nanophotonic structures is discussed.








Abstract
The scientific effort to control the interaction between light and matter has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades. This growth has been aided by the development of scientific and technological tools enabling the manipulation of light at deeply sub‐wavelength scales, unlocking a large variety of novel phenomena spanning traditionally distant research areas. Here, the role of chirality in light–matter interactions is reviewed by providing a broad overview of its properties, materials, and applications. A perspective on future developments is highlighted, including the growing role of machine learning in designing advanced chiroptical materials to enhance and control light–matter interactions across several scales.

      <title>Strain Engineering of Low‐Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain‐tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low‐dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain‐quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic‐angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron–electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain‐tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low‐dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain‐quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many‐body interactions and holds substantial promise for next‐generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

      <title>A Meta‐Device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by the magic stairs, an innovative and complementary integration of light‐field and structured‐light depth mapping and imaging system using a size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 meta‐lens array to measure the depth over a 30 cm range is shown. This compact, lightweight, low power consumption system can be used for autonomous systems in all light levels conditions.








Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth‐sensing due to the limited and specific light‐field information acquired by single‐lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, an intelligent and compact depth‐sensing meta‐device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels is demonstrated. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta‐lenses and a size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30 cm range with deep‐learning support. The meta‐lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta‐lens array can serve as the core functional component of a light‐field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured‐light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human–computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

      <title>A Reconfigurable Two‐WSe2‐Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward‐modulated spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (R‐STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti‐STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward‐modulated spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (R‐STDP) is a brain‐inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision‐making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward‐modulation process in R‐STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n‐type and the other as p‐type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/−1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti‐)STDP component of 2T cell, R‐STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart–pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low‐power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area‐efficient (100 µm2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

      <title>Progress and Challenges for Memtransistors in Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid‐state circuits and systems. Gate‐tunable learning and bio‐realistic functions in multi‐terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.








Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy‐efficient information processing of the brain. While non‐volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase‐change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi‐terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio‐realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low‐dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi‐terminal NVM devices including dual‐gated floating‐gate memories, dual‐gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual‐gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase‐changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer‐scale integration of memtransistors and multi‐terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

      <title>Graphene‐Based Microwave Circuits: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene‐based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high‐frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro‐ and millimeter‐wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene‐based field‐effect‐transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro‐ and millimeter‐wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high‐frequency applications.

      <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high‐harmonic generation and progressive low‐pass filtering effect. Time‐series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field‐effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high‐harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low‐pass filtering effect is realized where higher‐frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper‐layer RCs. Time‐series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

      <title>Machine Learning for Optical Scanning Probe Nanoscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Three main paradigms of machine learning—supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning—can be applied to optical scanning probe techniques in future instrumentation and data analysis to solve unique problems.








Abstract
The ability to perform nanometer‐scale optical imaging and spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low‐energy effects in quantum materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological samples. These tasks can be accomplished by the scattering‐type scanning near‐field optical microscopy (s‐SNOM) technique that has recently spread to many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. Herein, it is shown that the s‐SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in many ways from artificial‐intelligence (AI) and machine‐learning (ML) algorithms. Augmented with AI‐ and ML‐enhanced data acquisition and analysis, scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate, and intelligent.

      <title>Quantum‐Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next‐Generation Information Processing and Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices—from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin‐FETs, valley‐FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra‐energy‐efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid‐state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy‐efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band‐to‐band tunneling, spin–orbit coupling, spin–valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low‐dimensional and manufacture‐friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum‐engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum‐engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy‐efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D‐material scientists are provided.

      <title>Metasurface‐Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurface‐enhanced infrared spectroscopy has emerged as a highly sensitive tool for detecting and monitoring the constituents of molecular systems. This review showcases a variety of metaresonator sensors based on different resonance principles, geometries, and materials. The unique functionalities they offer for molecular studies, including dielectrophoresis‐based cell trapping and sensing, as well as AI‐augmented monitoring of biomolecular systems are discussed.








Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label‐free, noninvasive, and real‐time detection, infrared spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough applications for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far‐field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot‐spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light–matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface‐enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface‐enhanced infrared spectroscopy, a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials, and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices is showcased, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab‐on‐a‐chip devices. Furthermore, advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface‐based infrared spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine‐learning‐aided analysis are highlighted.

      <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti‐counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.








Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli‐responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state‐of‐the‐art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti‐counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next‐generation photonic materials.

      <title>Roles of MXene in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design, and Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
2D layered nanosheet MXene has been widely studied in pressure sensing due to the excellent mechanical and electrical properties, outstanding hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. To further promote the application of MXene in pressure sensors, the preparation of MXene, MXene‐based microstructures, MXene pressure‐sensor mechanisms, and the integration of multiple devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e‐skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red‐hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand‐new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e‐skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene‐based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e‐skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

      <title>Flexible Metamaterial Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest progress of novel flexible electronics with enhancing and innovating properties and functionalities stemming from the conceptual breakthrough of various metamaterials are reviewed; this burgeoning interdisciplinary field is coined as “flexible metamaterial electronics.” The artificial creation of metamaterials is able to break the current fetters and open a new direction for the further development of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Over the last decade, extensive efforts have been made on utilizing advanced materials and structures to improve the properties and functionalities of flexible electronics. While the conventional ways are approaching their natural limits, a revolutionary strategy, namely metamaterials, is emerging toward engineering structural materials to break the existing fetters. Metamaterials exhibit supernatural physical behaviors, in aspects of mechanical, optical, thermal, acoustic, and electronic properties that are inaccessible in natural materials, such as tunable stiffness or Poisson's ratio, manipulating electromagnetic or elastic waves, and topological and programmable morphability. These salient merits motivate metamaterials as a brand‐new research direction and have inspired extensive innovative applications in flexible electronics. Here, such a groundbreaking interdisciplinary field is first coined as “flexible metamaterial electronics,” focusing on enhancing and innovating functionalities of flexible electronics via the design of metamaterials. Herein, the latest progress and trends in this infant field are reviewed while highlighting their potential value. First, a brief overview starts with introducing the combination of metamaterials and flexible electronics. Then, the developed applications are discussed, such as self‐adaptive deformability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and multidisciplinary functionality, followed by the discussion of potential prospects. Finally, the challenges and opportunities facing flexible metamaterial electronics to advance this cutting‐edge field are summarized.

      <title>All‐Solid‐State Thin Film Lithium/Lithium‐Ion Microbatteries for Powering the Internet of Things</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All‐solid‐state thin‐film lithium/lithium‐ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid‐state battery architecture and thin‐film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on‐chip power sources for IoT‐enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium‐ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, we discuss the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet‐connected devices for the IoT. Recent progress in thin‐film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state‐of‐the‐art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next‐generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy‐harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices

      <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small‐scale Soft Robots</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Small‐scale soft robots have been attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real‐time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. In this review, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small‐scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing and swelling, small‐scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetic and other interdisciplinary sciences.

      <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large‐scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit‐level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high‐quality, wafer‐scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large‐scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

      <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/Nanoprocessing in Industrial Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The development trends, and advantages and deficiencies of three processing methods: micro/nanomolding, high‐energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining (microcutting, micro/nanowelding, and LIGA) are systematically summarized, adding to the existing body of knowledge for employing appropriate polymer processing techniques in customized industrial applications.








Abstract
Polymers are widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy‐harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nanoprocessing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high‐resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high‐resolution micro/nanostructures is explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small‐batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nanoprocessing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, the current state‐of‐the‐art techniques and future trends for micro/nanomolding, high‐energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining are discussed. Moreover, an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer‐based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors is provided. These techniques are expected to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next‐generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart, and biodegradable devices.

      <title>Building Practical High‐Voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium‐Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of lithium‐ion batteries is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. The key links in the development of the high‐voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization are considered and an overview of the challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high‐voltage cathode is presented.








Abstract
It has long been a global imperative to develop high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the ever‐growing electric vehicle market. One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of LIBs is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. As the most‐promising cathodes for high‐voltage LIBs (&gt;4 V vs Li/Li+), four major categories of cathodes including lithium‐rich layered oxides, nickel‐rich layered oxides, spinel oxides, and high‐voltage polyanionic compounds still encounter severe challenges to realize the improvement of output voltage while maintaining high capacity, fast rate capability, and long service life. This review focuses on the key links in the development of high‐voltage cathode materials from the lab to industrialization. First, the failure mechanisms of the four kinds of materials are clarified, and the optimization strategies, particularly solutions that are easy for large‐scale production, are considered. Then, to bridge the gap between lab and industry, the cost management, safety assessment, practical battery‐performance evaluation, and sustainability of the battery technologies, are discussed. Finally, tough challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high‐voltage cathode materials are summarized to promote the large‐scale application of LIBs with high energy densities.

However, the current smart devices centered on human health have disadvantages such as weak perception, high interference degree, and unfriendly interaction. Here, an intelligent health agent based on multifunctional fibers, with the characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility enabling health services, is proposed. According to the requirements for healthcare in the medical field and daily life, four major aspects driven by intelligent agents, including health monitoring, therapy, protection, and minimally invasive surgery, are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The function of intelligent health agents is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine. The structure, characteristics, and performance of fibers and analysis systems and algorithms are reviewed, while discussing future challenges and opportunities in healthcare and medicine. Finally, based on the above four aspects, future scenarios related to health protection of a person's life are presented. Intelligent health agents will have the potential to accelerate the realization of precision medicine and active health.

      <title>Conductive Metal–Organic Frameworks for Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
Conductive metal–organic frameworks (c‐MOFs), as an emerging class of electrode materials, have attracted great attention recently. The efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of c‐MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are reviewed. The recent achievements of developing supercapacitors with c‐MOF electrodes are discussed, from the experimental performance to a fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanism, highlighting their bottlenecks and perspectives.








Abstract
As a class of porous materials with crystal lattices, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring outstanding specific surface area, tunable functionality, and versatile structures, have attracted huge attention in the past two decades. Since the first conductive MOF is successfully synthesized in 2009, considerable progress has been achieved for the development of conductive MOFs, allowing their use in diverse applications for electrochemical energy storage. Among those applications, supercapacitors have received great interest because of their high power density, fast charging ability, and excellent cycling stability. Here, the efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of conductive MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are summarized. Using conductive MOFs as a unique platform medium, the electronic and molecular aspects of the energy storage mechanism in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes are discussed, highlighting the advantages and limitations to inspire new ideas for the development of conductive MOFs for supercapacitors.

      <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide‐temperature structural‐material construction, low‐temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

      <title>Intelligent Micro‐/Nanorobots for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on the recent advances of micro‐/nanorobots‐based cancer theragnostic is presented, ranging from actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery, as well as highlighting the most promising research opportunities for the next decade that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro‐/nanorobot (MNR)‐assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR‐based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles, which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re &lt;&lt; 1) environment by effective self‐propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next‐generation cancer‐therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging‐guided operation, and biosensing are additionally studied to enable the promising cancer‐related applications of MNRs. Herein, the recent advances in MNR‐based cancer therapy are comprehensively addresses, including actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; promising research opportunities that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade is highlighted.

      <title>Integrated Memory Devices Based on 2D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in emerging 2D‐material‐based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain‐inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D‐material‐based memory‐device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain‐inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state‐of‐the‐art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain‐inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

The developments of circuit‐level memory technologies and in‐memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large‐scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic‐in‐memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large‐scale 2D‐material‐based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D‐material‐based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large‐scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D‐material‐based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random‐access memory, static random‐access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in‐memory computing applications, mostly on logic‐in‐memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large‐scale applications of 2D‐material‐based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system‐level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

      <title>A Sparse and Spike‐Timing‐Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
A spike‐timing‐dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2‐based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy and area efficient in‐sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike‐timing‐based encoding. Here a medium‐scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three‐stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21 memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D monolayer MoS2 for spike‐timing‐based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time‐to‐first‐spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non‐volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low‐light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright‐light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1 µJ by the 2D‐memtransistor‐based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in‐sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1 µJ by the 2D‐memtransistor‐based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in‐sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

      <title>Advances in Biodegradable Electronic Skin: Material Progress and Recent Applications in Sensing, Robotics, and Human–Machine Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e‐waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of our planet. Currently, the demand for wearable and flexible electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e‐skin), and health monitoring platforms is substantial and growing. Therefore, “green” characteristics such as biodegradability, self‐healing behavior, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e‐skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e‐skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e‐skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic polymer‐based materials, and their most recent applications in the development of biodegradable e‐skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human–machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e‐skins are critically discussed in a near‐future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e‐skins and electronics.

      <title>Complex oxides for brain‐inspired computing: A review</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The fields of brain‐inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human‐designed electronics and machines. Most advances to date have happened in software and algorithms. However, there is growing interest in designing hardware, i.e., new semiconductor materials and devices and their interconnections that can impart intelligence at the device or network level for software co‐design. This requires a paradigm shift in the way one thinks of semiconductors where the intrinsic material or device itself can learn, be re‐programmed, remember or forget information and, when connected, collectively create output signals that are non‐trivial, emergent summation of individual components. In this review, we discuss the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature. Most importantly, oxides can host a vast number of electrically addressable metastable phases by carrier doping and subtle crystal structure distortions essential for adaptive devices. Concurrent changes in optical or magnetic properties create opportunities for multi‐modal readout. Since neuroscience and evolutionary biology disciplines serve as an inspiration and scientific guiding disciplines for neuromorphic computing, we begin with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect we highlight here is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. We then focus on phenomena such as metal‐to‐insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and related examples to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning behavior. First‐principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure; in‐situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices is then discussed. We review the implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design. Finally, we highlight outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing.

      <title>A Memristors‐Based Dendritic Neuron for High‐Efficiency Spatial‐Temporal Information Processing</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike‐firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high‐efficiency spatial‐temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio‐plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human‐motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000× higher powerefficiency than a graphics processing unit.








Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy‐efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a titanium oxide (TiOx)‐based interface‐type dynamic memristor and an niobium oxide (NbOx)‐based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike‐firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high‐efficiency spatial‐temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware‐implemented for spatial‐temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the Nanyang Technological University‐Red Green Blue (NTU‐RGB) dataset as a benchmark spatial‐temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors‐based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000× advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the graphics processing unit (GPU). The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio‐plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial‐temporal tasks with high efficiency.
